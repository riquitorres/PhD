PhD thesis "The Coastal Transition Zone  of the Galician Region: Upper Layer Response to Wind Forcing and Circulation"

To re-compile this old tex thesis I have needed to install
sudo dnf install 'tex(sidecap.sty)'
sudo dnf install 'tex(tabfigures.sty)'
sudo dnf install 'tex(tocbibind.sty)'
sudo dnf install 'tex(numname.sty)'
sudo dnf install 'tex(gitinfo.sty)'
sudo dnf install 'tex(refstyle.sty)'
sudo dnf install 'tex(chngctr.sty)'


I downloaded thesis.cls from 
https://github.com/richfitz/thesis-style/blob/master/mythesis.cls
And added a few changes to make it more similar to the original mythesis.cls that I can no longer find and I used in my original submission of the thesis. 
There are some differences between the pdf this repository generates and what was submitted

and 
psboxit.sty from CTAN and added it to the local directory. However, this didn't perform as the original thesis format.
