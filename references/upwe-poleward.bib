	  Chile (18 degreesS-24 degreesS) upwelling region are used to
	  calculate the surface and subsurface seasonal climatology extending
	  400 km offshore. The data are interpolated to a grid with
	  sufficient spatial resolution to preserve cross-shelf gradients and
	  then presented as means within four seasons: austral winter
	  (July-September), spring (October-December), summer (January-
	  March), and fall (April-June). Climatological monthly wind forcing,
	  surface temperature, and sea level from three coastal stations
	  indicate equatorward (upwelling favorable) winds throughout the
	  year, weakest in the north. Seasonal maximum alongshore wind stress
	  is in late spring and summer (DecemberMarch). Major water masses
	  of the region are identified in climatological T-S plots and their
	  sources and implied circulation discussed. Surface fields and
	  vertical transects of temperature and salinity confirm that
	  upwelling occurs year- round, strongest in summer and weakest in
	  winter, bringing relatively fresh water to the surface nearshore.
	  Surface geostrophic flow nearshore is equatorward throughout the
	  year. During summer, an anticyclonic circulation feature in the
	  north which extends to at least 200 m depth is evident in
	  geopotential anomaly and in both temperature and geopotential
	  variance fields. Subsurface fields indicate generally poleward flow
	  throughout the year, strongest in an undercurrent near the coast.
	  This undercurrent is strongest in summer and most persistent and
	  organized in the south (south of 21 degreesS), A subsurface oxygen
	  minimum, centered at similar to 250 m, is strongest at lower
	  latitudes. Low-salinity subsurface water intrudes into the study
	  area near 100 m, predominantly in offshore regions, strongest
	  during summer and fall and in the southernmost portion of the
	  region. The climatological fields are compared to features off Baja
	  within the somewhat analogous California Current and to
	  measurements from higher latitudes within the Chile-Peru Current

	  the Santa Barbara Channel. Poleward flow relative to 500 m is found

	  subregions except the western part of the Santa Barbara Channel. In
	  spring there is equatorward flow throughout the bight at all depths
	  to 500 m, though it tends to be surface or midcolumn intensified.
	  Equatorward flow offshore of the bight, present in all seasons,

	  moves close to the Santa Rosa Ridge in summer. Current meter data
	  from the eastern entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel are
	  consistent with the seasonal results from the CalCOFI data and
	  further show an upward propagation of phase at annual period, with
	  a phase speed of 1 to 2 m d(-1). Comparison with the CalCOFI ship
	  winds suggests that poleward flow in the bight may be the result of
	  positive wind stress curl, through a Sverdrup balance, though the
	  observed transport is only about 75\% of that expected from the
	  curl amplitude. Equatorward flow in the bight may be the result of
	  coastal upwelling, though the transport is larger than expected
	  from the relatively weak winds in the bight, and the offshore
	  extent of the equatorward flow is about 10 Rossby radii, farther
	  than might be expected for linearized coastal upwelling.
	  Equatorward flow outside the bight cannot be explained as a
	  Sverdrup flow because the wind stress curl is positive throughout
	  mast of the region. Upward propagation of phase and downward
	  propagation of energy may be indicative of forcing by remote wind
	  equatorward of the bight. Given the complexity of possible forcing
	  mechanisms for circulation in and near the bight, a model that
	  includes effects of remote wind forcing, Ekman pumping, and
	  topography is needed to explain the observations in a satisfactory
	  way.

	  extended 14 km offshore. Though shorter, the northern line spanned
	  similar water depths because the gradient of the topography
	  steepened in the northern region. A poleward flow pattern, typical
	  of the California undercurrent, was seen across both lines in the
	  array over most of the year. The poleward flow was surface
	  intensified. In general, the portion of the undercurrent that

	  force the poleward flow offshore of the northern measurement sites.
	  The slope of the topography steepened too abruptly to allow the
	  poleward flow to follow isobaths when currents were strong. When

	  significant fraction of the current variance over the midand
	  outer slope was driven by the surface wind stress. An alongshelf
	  wind stress caused cut-rents to flow along the slope, parallel to
	  the wind field, down to depths of 400 m below the surface and out
	  to distances of 2 Rossby radii past the shelf break. The transfer
	  functions were weak, 3-4 cm/s per dyn cm(-2) but comparable to

	  out in May 1993 is qualitatively good. The model is also able to
	  represent the seasonal cycle in the area as revealed by cruises
	  carried out in November 1993 and July/August 1994. Quantitative
	  agreement between the model and the observations is less good and
	  this is a result of limitations in the data used to force the model
	  at the surface and the boundaries. Features of the circulation
	  which are modeled well include seasonal coastal upwelling, the
	  winter Portugal Coastal Countercurrent and the spreading of
	  Mediterranean Water. Coastal upwelling occurs in summer and is
	  enhanced off Cape Finisterre: and Cape Roca. The Portugal Coastal
	  Countercurrent exists in the model as a poleward flow over the
	  upper continental slops which is strongest in winter but persists
	  throughout the year and in summer is seen as a weak sub-surface
	  feature. Mediterranean Water spreads northwards in two cores with a
	  distinct focussing towards the coast to the north of the Tagus
	  Plateau. The particular form of open boundary conditions employed
	  perform well with little evidence of false reflection of outgoing
	  waves. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

	  Channel and off the coast of central and southern California is

	  surface from 12 sites within the channel at bimonthly intervals.
	  This description includes small-scale features of the circulation
	  which are not part of descriptions based on moored observations or
	  of the statistics of the drifter releases. The eventual fate of
	  drifters at long time intervals compared to the residence time in
	  the channel (about 7 days) is also included. In the channel the
	  trajectories document a persistent cyclonic circulation with a
	  typical recirculation period between 3 and 5 days. In the spring,
	  currents near the mainland are weaker than near the Channel
	  Islands, and the overall flow is toward the southeast. Trajectories
	  document the possibility for water parcels to leave the channel
	  through the interisland passes. In the late fall and winter a
	  poleward flow with velocities often exceeding 0.5 m s(-1) is
	  confined within 20 km of the mainland. Between these two seasons
	  the cyclonic tendency is enhanced, although most of the drifters
	  eventually migrate westward. The trajectories of drifters released
	  at the same time from sites only 20 km apart can be remarkably
	  different. Once the drifters migrate out of the channel, their
	  trajectories can be grouped into a few patterns. In spring and
	  summer, drifters tend to remain in the Southern California Eight.
	  Their trajectories often remain close over extended periods, as if
	  they were caught in convergence zones. In fall the drifters often
	  are caught in a poleward current.

	  based on the topological theory and "open separation," and whether
	  a separation line is an asymptote or envelope of neighboring
	  skin-friction lines. General criteria for identifying an "open" or

	  three-dimensional triple-deck structure near a generic boundary

	  watch," which tells that a boundary-layer may soon break away, and
	  for "separation warning," which identifies the vorticity
	  characteristics in an already formed boundary-layer separation zone
	  and along a boundary-layer separation line. Flow behavior and its
	  dependence on outer flow conditions are examined qualitatively. A
	  numerical example is given which confirms the predictions of the
