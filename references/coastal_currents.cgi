TI How does the El Nino-generated coastal current propagate past
   the Mendocino escarpment?
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB During an El Nino, an internal coastal Kelvin wave bore
   propagates poleward along the west coast of North America,
   leaving behind a steady anomalous coastal jet. B nonlinear,
   two-layer, f plane, shallow-water model is used to determine
   the amplitude change of the steady coastal current over an
   escarpment. As the El Nino-generated warm coastal current
   passes the Mendocino escarpment off northern California, its
   amplitude is marginally enhanced. In contrast, for a cord
   coastal current, the amplitude will be reduced north of the
   Mendocino escarpment. When the Kelvin wave bore travels over a
   depth increase, the amplitude change is predicted to be much
   larger than over a depth decrease (as in the case of the
   Mendocino escarpment). This model is also applicable to bottom
   water flowing equatorward along a western boundary. In this
   case, much larger amplitude changes are found.

TI High-resolution satellite-derived sea-surface temperature
   variability over the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank region,
   1993-1996
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses were completed
   using 3 yr (fall 1993 through late-summer 1996) of 1.4-km
   resolution, satellite-derived sea-surface temperature (SST)
   imagery from a large domain that includes the Gulf of Maine,
   Georges Bank, southern New England and western Scotian shelves,
   and the adjacent slope water region located seaward of the 200-
   m isobath. Prior to analysis, raw satellite-derived SST images
   were carefully cloud masked using automated and manual cloud
   detection techniques and then interpolated to a 7-km resolution
   grid using optimal interpolation (OI). OI resulted in 218
   cloud-free, five-day-averaged SST fields, produced at five-day
   intervals for the study period. After removal of the 3 yr
   temporal mean SST at each gridpoint, a covariance EOF analysis
   of OI SST shows three significant modes, accounting for a total
   of 96.5% of observed SST variance. A gradient EOF analysis also
   shows three significant modes, accounting for a total of 92.7%
   of observed SST variance after removal of the spatial mean SST
   from each OI SST field. Covariance EOF modes 1 and 3 represent
   92.2 and 1.3% of observed SST variance, and depict rich spatial
   structure in the seasonal heating cycle and additional spatial
   variation in the seasonal heating cycle over the study domain,
   respectively. SST variability noted for covariance EOF mode 1
   is largely related to local differences in the seasonal mixed-
   layer depth, with deeper mixed layers resulting from strong
   tidal mixing over offshore banks and shoals contrasting with
   more- shallow-mixed layers and seasonal density stratification
   caused by weaker tidal mixing over regions of greater bottom
   depth. Additional spatial differences in seasonal SST
   variability and noted in covariance EOF mode 3 are related to
   regional differences in seasonal thermohaline and density
   characteristics of surface waters across the Gulf of Maine.
   Regional surface water differences across the Gulf of Maine are
   caused by different phasing between annual cycles of vertical
   heat flux and inputs of low-salinity Scotian Shelf water in
   eastern Gulf of Maine during late winter and local freshwater
   runoff from rivers in western Gulf of Maine during late spring.
   Covariance EOF mode 2 represents 3.0% of observed SST variance
   and describes interannual SST variability manifested by a
   cooling trend within the slope water region caused by a
   decrease in Gulf Stream warm-core ring activity during the
   study period. The gradient EOF analysis shows results that
   support and supplement the covariance EOF analysis by depicting
   the year-round nature of the SST gradient associated with the
   shelf break front (mode 1, 86.4% of SST variance) and SST
   gradients arising from spatial variation in the seasonal
   heating cycle (modes 2 and 3, 4.3% and 2.0% of SST variance,
   respectively) and some degree of interannual variability as
   described for covariance EOF mode 2 (mode 3). (C) 2000 Elsevier

TI The California Current system in the Southern California Bight
   and the Santa Barbara channel
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Recent observations in the Santa Barbara Channel and over the
   California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations
   (CalCOFI) southern California grid are used to examine seasonal
   circulation patterns in and near the Southern California Eight,
   defined as the region east of the Santa Rosa Ridge and
   including the Santa Barbara Channel. Poleward flow relative to
   500 m is found throughout the bight, in all seasons except for
   spring and all subregions except the western part of the Santa
   Barbara Channel. In spring there is equatorward flow throughout
   the bight at all depths to 500 m, though it tends to be surface
   or midcolumn intensified. Equatorward flow offshore of the
   bight, present in all seasons, narrows and accelerates into a
   jet-like feature and simultaneously moves close to the Santa
   Rosa Ridge in summer. Current meter data from the eastern
   entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel are consistent with the
   seasonal results from the CalCOFI data and further show an
   upward propagation of phase at annual period, with a phase
   speed of 1 to 2 m d(-1). Comparison with the CalCOFI ship winds
   suggests that poleward flow in the bight may be the result of
   positive wind stress curl, through a Sverdrup balance, though
   the observed transport is only about 75% of that expected from
   the curl amplitude. Equatorward flow in the bight may be the
   result of coastal upwelling, though the transport is larger
   than expected from the relatively weak winds in the bight, and
   the offshore extent of the equatorward flow is about 10 Rossby
   radii, farther than might be expected for linearized coastal
   upwelling. Equatorward flow outside the bight cannot be
   explained as a Sverdrup flow because the wind stress curl is
   positive throughout mast of the region. Upward propagation of
   phase and downward propagation of energy may be indicative of
   forcing by remote wind equatorward of the bight. Given the
   complexity of possible forcing mechanisms for circulation in
   and near the bight, a model that includes effects of remote
   wind forcing, Ekman pumping, and topography is needed to
   explain the observations in a satisfactory way.

TI Bifurcation of a coastal current at an escarpment
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The evolution of a coastal current as it encounters an
   escarpment depends strongly on whether the geometry of the
   coast and escarpment is right or left "handed," independent of
   the direction of the coastal current. Handedness is defined
   such that right-handed means that when looking across the
   escarpment from the deep to the shallow side, the coast is
   found on the right. The essential aspects of the difference in
   behavior of the current in the two geometries are captured by a
   simple quasigeostrophic model of coastal flow over a step. An
   exact analytic solution to the nonlinear stationary problem is
   obtained. This solution shows that, when a coastal current
   crosses an escarpment in the left-handed geometry, the speed of
   the current will increase independent of whether the flow is
   from shallow to deep or from deep to shallow. For the right-
   handed geometry, the speed of the current decreases, also
   independent of the direction of the coastal flow. In the left
   (right)-handed geometry, there is associated to the coastal
   flow an inshore (offshore) current along the escarpment. These
   results are explained in terms of linear wave theory and vortex
   dynamics. Numerical simulations are used to examine the
   evolution of the flow from the initial encounter to the
   establishment of a stationary flow. The relevance of this
   research is discussed in light of recent results from
   laboratory experiments and oceanic observations.

TI Instability of the Mediterranean Water undercurrents southwest
   of Portugal: effects of baroclinicity and of topography
SO OCEANOLOGICA ACTA
AB Southwest of Portugal, in situ data show that part of the
   mesoscale variability of the Mediterranean Water undercurrents
   is triggered by topographic effects (near capes and submarine
   canyons), and is driven by a dominantly baroclinic instability.
   The vertical alignment of these undercurrents observed at sites
   of eddy formation is indeed favorable to baroclinic
   instability. This instability is materialized by the formation
   of filaments and of small eddies in the Portimao canyon and of
   meddles near Cape Saint Vincent and near the Estramadura
   Promontory. Hydrological data and float trajectories reveal
   that these eddies have a baroclinic structure. Near Portimao
   canyon, the variation of the potential vorticity of the
   undercurrents again proves their sensitivity to baroclinic and
   also to barotropic instabilities, enhanced by the canyon.
   Finally, a model of stationary coastal current explains the
   variations of its horizontal structure over a canyon. (C) 2000

TI Dynamics of separating western boundary currents
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB In this work, Pratt and Stern's quasigeostrophic, 1 1/2-layer,
   infinite jet model is connected to a western boundary by a
   system of two converging boundary currents. The model has a
   piecewise constant potential vorticity structure and the
   departing jet has a zonal cusplike profile in the ocean
   interior. The relative strengths of the coastal jets can be
   varied and the coastline can be tilted relative to north. The
   coastline tilt and the coastal current asymmetry cause an
   alongshore momentum imbalance that creates a spatially damped,
   quasi-stationary wave pattern. The presence of the boundary
   favors the long waves in the model, which behave fairly
   linearly in all study cases. The effects of the coastline tilt
   and the coastal current asymmetry are varied to reinforce or
   cancel each other. In the former case, a retroflection type of
   boundary current separation, like the one observed in most
   Southern Hemisphere western boundary currents, is obtained. In
   the latter case, a much smoother separation results, as when
   the Gulf Stream leaves the North American coast. In order to
   comply with the piecewise constant potential vorticity
   constraint, the beta effect is included in the model only very
   crudely. The "beta" term in the potential vorticity
   relationship is totally compensated for by a steady flow
   pattern similar to the edge between two Fofonoff gyres. It is
   found that when beta is nonzero, the wavelengths are somewhat
   shorter than those of f-plane cases.

TI The hydraulics of an evolving upwelling jet flowing around a
   cape
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Upwelling jets flow alongshore in approximate geostrophic
   balance with the onshore pressure gradient induced by coastal
   upwelling. Observations of such jets have shown that they often
   move offshore downstream of capes, leaving a pool of upwelled
   water inshore. Comparisons are made between this behavior and
   the hydraulic transition of a potential-vorticity-conserving
   coastal current as it passes a topographic anomaly at which it
   is exactly critical to long coastal-trapped waves. An analytic
   1.5-layer model of coastal hydraulics with constant potential
   vorticity in each layer predicts flow fields (i.e., jet
   separation) in critical situations that resemble observations.
   When scales approximate Cape Blanco on the Oregon coast,
   separation occurs at a jet transport of around 0.76 x 10(6)
   m(3) s(-1), similar to observed transports. Time-dependent,
   semigeostrophic calculations suggest that, during an upwelling
   season, the jet would evolve from a weak flow, which was
   subcritical everywhere and symmetric about the cape, to an
   exactly critical state that made a transition from subcritical
   to supercritical structure at the head of the cape. The
   predicted flow field at critical transition consists of a
   narrow upwelling jet upstream of the cape that moves offshore
   and broadens at the cape. This critical state would be
   accompanied by a downstream jump back to subcritical
   conditions. Further upwelling-favorable winds would lead to
   transient waves that propagated upstream and downstream,
   modifying the upstream and downstream conditions and restoring
   criticality. Thus, the head of the cape exerts hydraulic
   control on the flow and prevents the jet transport from
   increasing above its critical level. Inherent in the hydraulic
   approach is the assumption that alongshore scales are large.
   For realistic alongshore scales, solutions modified by
   coastline curvature suggest that the convexity of the head of a
   cape slightly inhibits the transition to a strongly upwelled
   downstream state by increasing the required critical transport.
   In the presence of topographic features with finite alongshore
   scale, the hydraulic approach can be used to construct a flow
   field, although this flow field has an inherent error arising
   from the implicit assumptions regarding scales. Estimation of
   this error for topography representing Cape Blanco suggests
   that in places the cape is rather abrupt for hydraulic theory
   to be valid.

TI Seasonal variability of the Bay of Bengal circulation inferred
   from TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB The circulation in the interior of the Bay of Bengal and of its
   western boundary current, the East Indian Coastal Current, is
   inferred from historical ship drift data and from
   TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data. The boundary current shows a
   strong seasonal variability with reversals twice per year that
   lead the reversal of the local monsoon wind field by several
   months. On the basis of model simulations it has been suggested
   that this unusual behavior can be explained by the influence of
   remotely forced planetary waves. Our data analysis confirms and
   refines this view by showing the role of topography in the
   northern bay. We also give an estimate of the relative
   importance of the different contributions.

TI Theory of the Benguela upwelling system
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The paper gives a theoretical study of the Benguela upwelling
   system by means of a relatively simple conceptual model that
   allows an analytical treatment. The model consists of a
   stratified, flat-bottomed coastal ocean. The coast is idealized
   by a straight wall. The model ocean is forced by an alongshore
   wind band extending from the area near Cape Town to the border
   of Angola and Namibia. The wind varies alongshore and cross-
   shore (wind stress curl) and changes periodically in time. The
   response of the coastal ocean is governed by coastal jets,
   upwelling, and Kelvin waves, as well as by a current system
   driven by the wind stress curl. The model is able to reproduce
   several observed features such as the poleward undercurrent,
   the northward coastal currents in most of the wind band, and a
   southward coastal current near the northern edge of the wind
   band. Export of coastal jets out of the forcing area by coastal
   Kelvin waves provide a mechanism to guide energy into the area
   off Cape Town. The southward propagating Kelvin waves may bend
   around the southern tip of Africa and provide a dynamic linkage
   between the Benguela coastal current and the Agulhas Current.

TI Penetration of buoyant coastal discharge onto the continental
   shelf: A numerical model experiment
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Plumes of buoyant water produced by inflow from rivers and
   estuaries are common on the continental shelf. Typically they
   turn anticyclonically to flow alongshelf as buoyancy-driven
   coastal currents. During this passage, mixing with ambient
   shelf water gradually erodes the plume buoyancy so that its
   alongshelf penetration is finite. This paper addresses the
   extent of this penetration and how it is determined by
   fundamental dimensionless flow parameters. A three-dimensional
   numerical model is applied to an idealized flow regime. Ambient
   shelf conditions include tidal motion, but neither wind stress
   nor ambient alongshelf current. The alongshelf extent of
   penetration is evaluated after the plume reaches a stationary
   condition downshelf. A total of 66 model experiments are
   conducted. including variations in buoyant source and ambient
   shelf properties. Five dimensionless parameters determine the
   alongshelf and across-shelf penetration, the latter the coastal
   current width. The most critical of these is tau the source
   volume transport scaled by the associated source geostrophic
   transport, For fixed shelf bottom slope and no tides,
   similarity forms are Found for both alongshelf and across-shelf
   penetration for a wide range of tau. Increased shelf bottom
   slope and increased shelf tidal amplitude shorten the
   alongshelf penetration. The vertical turbulent closure scheme
   itself contributes one of the five model parameters, the
   background eddy viscosity or diffusivity. This background
   viscosity v is added to the viscosity determined From the
   Mellor-Yamada level 2.5 closure scheme to give N, the vertical
   viscosity used by the model. Where the local Richardson number
   exceeds about 0.2, as in most buoyant plumes, the Mellor-Yamada
   scheme "switches off," forcing N to default to v. Plume
   penetration properties thus are found to depend significantly
   on v. At present one must choose v arbitrarily, thus
   introducing uncertainty into the model results.

TI Separation of a coastal current at a strait level: Case of the
   Strait of Sicily
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The separation of a coastal current into two branches when
   encountering a strait, one entering the strait and the other
   crossing the strait and continuing to how along the coast, is
   examined. Analytical solution shows that the strait topography
   plays a major role in the separation. When the depth of the
   sill of the strait is shallower than the ocean, double Kelvin
   waves propagate along the sill discontinuity line and are able
   to transport energy across the strait. The shallower the sill,
   the smaller the transport of the surface current entering the
   strait at the upstream corner and the larger the transport of
   the current transmitted across the strait. Sensitivity
   experiments done with a high-resolution primitive equation
   model confirm this behavior. These considerations explain the
   separation of the Algerian current into two branches at the
   Strait of Sicily: orle entering the Eastern Mediterranean Sea
   and the other flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea.

TI Features of coastal current instabilities in the North Sea:
   Results of a numerical model
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Coastal currents that are forced by buoyancy discharges from
   rivers often show a tendency to become unstable under certain
   conditions. Two such coastal current systems in the North Sea,
   the German Eight and the Skagerrak, and their instabilities are
   investigated and compared here with the help of a fully
   nonlinear, three-dimensional, baroclinic circulation model.
   Differences between the two regions were found with respect to
   three, main aspects. First, in the Skagerrak, instabilities
   contribute to the kinetic energy on a scale that is comparable
   to the mean kinetic energy. This does not hold for the German
   Eight. Second, of the two forms of instabilities fed by
   baroclinic and barotropic energy conversion, in the Skagerrak,
   barotropic conversion is as important as baroclinic
   instability, while in the German Eight, baroclinic conversion
   clearly dominates. Finally, in the German Eight, instability
   tends to occur only if supported by wind in a direction that
   helps establishing a steep front against strong tidal mixing.
   One explanation for the distinction in the features of the two
   regions is the water depth (German Eight is <40 m; Skagerrak is
   similar to 300 m) and, consequently, the amount of tidal mixing
   applied to the near-surface coastal current front. Several deep
   and shallow water coastal currents outside the North Sea are
   found to exhibit features similar to those presented for the
   Skagerrak and German Eight.

TI Advection of upwelled waters in the form of plumes off Oman
   during the Southwest Monsoon
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery of
   sea-surface-temperature, TOPEX/POSEIDON measurements of sea-
   level-anomaly (SLA), and modeled surface winds and wind-stress
   fields are used in concert with other ancillary data to
   describe the influence of the 1995 Southwest Monsoon on the
   distribution of upwelled waters off the coast of Oman. The Oman
   upwelling zone is characterized by the entrainment of cold
   upwelled waters into plumes extending from the coast into the
   deep ocean unaffected by the steep bottom gradients. The most
   prominent of these plumes is found offshore of Ras al Madraka.
   A mechanism for the entrainment of upwelled water into plumes
   is hypothesized, and validated by observational data. It is
   proposed that the location of the plume is primarily governed
   by the sea level structure away from the coast and that
   coastally upwelled water is passively advected offshore through
   regions of low sea level. Analysis of the surface wind-stress
   fields show significant spatial variability associated with the
   predominantly cyclonic mean wind-stress curl, with relatively
   weak curl observed in the region south of Ras al Madraka and
   north of Ras Marbat. Decomposition of the surface wind-stress
   fields through Principal Component Analysis shows that, at
   certain periods, the development of strong along-shore winds
   and cyclonic wind-stress curl in the region north of Ras al
   Madraka. This information, combined with concurrent
   observations of TOPEX/POSEIDON sea-level-anomalies (SLAs),
   satellite derived sea-surface-temperatures (SST), and surface
   current measurements, shows that the combined effects of a
   strong along-shore wind field and positive wind-stress curl
   forces a depression in sea level in the region north of Ras al
   Madraka. The sea level gradient, caused by the presence of a
   sustained high sea level to the south of Ras al Madraka, causes
   geostrophic advection of coastally upwelled waters away from
   the shelf. Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) velocity
   measurements along with SST maps further prove that the
   upwelled water is geostrophically advected offshore as opposed
   to being an offshore deflection of a wind-driven coastal
   current. Comparison of interannual features in the
   TOPEX/POSEIDON SLAs suggest that the plumes coming off coast in
   the Oman upwelling zone may not be directly linked to the
   coastal topography or bathymetry but are a result of
   interaction between mesoscale variations in the wind held and
   the underlying ocean. The strong along-shore winds and cyclonic
   wind-stress curl to the north of Ras al Madraka becomes
   enhanced when the Findlater Jet moves closer to the Oman coast
   than its mean position. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

TI Observations of an inshore front associated with the Chesapeake

SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB Preliminary observations are reported of a recurring front
   located near Cape Henry, Virginia, USA. The front occurs on the
   right-hand side, looking seaward, of the buoyant plume
   discharging from the Chesapeake Bay and separates the plume
   from a band of relatively dense seawater confined against the
   Virginia coast. The front thus appears to be of a type similar
   to the inshore plume front reported by Sanders and Garvine for
   the Delaware Bay. Similar to an estuarine tidal intrusion
   front, the Cape Henry front evolves to a prominent V-shaped
   planform during flood tide and subduction of fluid along the

TI Monitoring a shelf edge current using bottom pressures or

   due to geostrophy. A predominantly barotropic current along the

   upstream. The evidence suggests that changes in the slope
   current are established on the time scale of a few days along
   the entire continental slope, apparently forced by sea-level
   changes in the northeast Atlantic. Correcting for atmospheric
   pressure and the buoyancy of the coastal water near the tide
   gauge at Bodo, we obtain five-day running average coastal sea-
   level fluctuations that correlate to within 15% of observed
   current and bottom pressure gradient fluctuations 300 km away.
   The extension of the derived relation for monitoring this flow
   over large distances, with a time resolution of 5 days is
   demonstrated. Improved quality of the measurements is needed to
   reduce the inherent sources of noise. Part of the noise is due
   to mesoscale variability in the coastal current. This can be
   reduced by averaging over longer times. The method fails at
   higher time resolutions due to atmospheric variability, basin
   modes and other processes that are unaccounted for in the
   simple geostrophic model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

TI The Algerian current: comparisons between in situ and
   laboratory data sets
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB The Algerian current is compared to a laboratory current
   created in a rotating tank. The experimental current flows
   along a regular wall and over a motionless denser water, with a
   constant flow rate and a uniform velocity at the source. Data
   collected in the laboratory are compared with satellite and in
   situ data sets. The various characteristic phenomena are shown
   to be similar: both currents are unstable and generate meanders
   and cyonic-anticyclonic eddy-pairs. Eventually, the anticyclone
   remains and is associated with a marked lowering of the
   interface. The phase speed and growth of the meanders and the
   shape and size of the eddies in the laboratory are in quite
   good agreement with those deduced from in situ data and
   satellite images. The observations and the velocity and
   interface height measurements in the laboratory allow a better
   understanding of the Algerian current dynamics and its

TI Simulation of a coastal jet retention process using a
   barotropic model
SO OCEANOLOGICA ACTA
AB In the southern Benguela, sardine and anchovy spawn on the
   Western Agulhas Bank. Eggs and larvae are transported to the
   West coast nursery ground by a! coastal current. Once the
   larvae reach the West coast, retention within the favorable
   coastal domain is key to larvae survival and recruitment. The
   Cape Columbine-St Helena Bay area is the main nursery ground
   along the West Coast. In this area, the interaction between
   upwelling and topography results in the formation of an
   upwelling plume. The plume, and the associated circulation
   patterns, is thought to be the mechanism providing retention
   within the coastal domain. The dynamics of the plume are
   studied using a set of:numerical experiments. It is shown that
   an equatorward wind forcing produces a cyclonic eddy in the lee
   of Cape Columbine. A balance between advection and bottom
   friction regulates the evolution of this eddy. The eddy
   contributes to create a dynamic boundary between the coastal
   and the offshore domains. Retention induced by the eddy is
   quantified using a tracer. The magnitude of retention is
   positively related to the wind for weak to moderate wind
   intensities. For strong wind intensity, retention reaches a
   maximum or slightly decreases. This is in agreement with
   previous results relating recruitment success with wind speed.

TI Seasonality of the European slope current (Goban Spur) and
   ocean margin exchange
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB Eight years of current data, 5.5 years of Eulerian current
   meter data and 2 years of Lagrangian data, are analysed in the
   context of seasonality along the continental slope margin of NW
   Europe, across shelfbreak flow and continental shelf flow.
   Long-term records from the continental slope at the similar to
   1000 m depth contour on Goban Spur and Little Sole Bank Spur
   show maximum recorded currents in the range 39-43 cm s(-1), but
   typical maximum monthly mean values are similar to 10 cm s(-1)
   in the upper half of the water column. On the slope, the flow
   is predominantly poleward in the general alongslope direction
   with maximum flow in winter (December-January). The spur
   situation can result in four preferred directions of alongslope
   flow which due to topographic control is less evident near the
   sea floor ( similar to 50 m up), where the flow is
   predominantly poleward. Equatorward upper layer flow tends to
   occur in the spring (March-April) period but can extend to the
   sea floor and into the summer period nearer the sea surface.
   Some seasonal signatures correlate with sea level anomalies
   seen in altimeter data in the continental slope and shelf
   region. May infrared remote sensing images show cool water
   separating from the upper slope ( similar to 1 km water depth
   contour) region of Goban Spur both in a WNW and SSW direction
   (i.e. the off-slope preferred flow directions) reflecting both
   poleward and equatorward flows. The seasonal results are
   discussed in terms of the SOMA (September-October/March-April)
   seasonal response. The long-term or near annual Eulerian
   residual mean flows were typically 2 cm s(-1) throughout the
   water column and poleward in the alongslope direction. The
   upper layer (30 m depth) shelf currents, similar to 30 km
   onshelf from the Goban Spur shelfbreak, were markedly onshelf
   with a Eulerian mean of 6 cm s(-1) over a 129-day period. A
   carefully prepared drogued Argos buoy (drogued at 45 m depth),
   and deliberately placed for subsequent along continental shelf
   margin movement, released a further 100 km onshelf, moved
   northward and parallel to the western Celtic shelfbreak towards
   the south of Ireland. Here the drogued buoy found the Valentia
   Coastal Current, passed west of Ireland on the mid-shelf, then
   along the continental shelfbreak (200 m contour) and through
   the LOIS SES site, reaching a maximum speed of 66 cm s(-1) (12
   h average). The drogued buoy entered the Northern North Sea,
   north of the Shetland Isles, travelling a distance of similar
   to 1600 km over a period of 5 months. Drogued buoys were
   deployed in the ocean and on the shelf. Overall, it is shown
   that the continental slope is an insulator for ocean shelf
   exchange but the ocean margin is a conductor for advective
   influences from the south. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

TI Observations of a pulsed buoyancy current downstream of
   Chesapeake Bay
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB A plume of low-salinity water was observed along the North
   Carolina coast 100 km south of the mouth of Chesapeake Bay
   during the Coastal Ocean Processes Pilot field program
   conducted from August through October 1994. The presence of the
   plume was episodic, occurring every 3 to 8 days. The timing was
   related to wind patterns, which influence both the delivery of
   estuarine discharge to the shelf and the plume's passage down
   the coast. When not affected by local winds, the low-salinity
   water was confined to within 7-9 km of the coast and was about
   8 m deep. Downwelling winds narrow and deepen the plume,
   whereas upwelling winds cause it to thin and spread offshore,
   eventually detaching from the coast. The low-salinity plume
   propagated along the coast at speeds comparable to linear
   internal wave phase speed, except when strong downwelling wind
   conditions caused the plume to be in contact with the bottom.
   The observed propagation speeds are faster than those predicted
   by previous numerical modeling efforts. The plumes slowed with
   distance from the source, as mixing with ambient shelf water
   reduced the density contrast. This buoyancy source was balanced
   by an alongshore current with a southward velocity of 0.3 to
   0.7 m s(-1) bounded by a region of high horizontal velocity
   shear at the offshore salinity front. currents observed in the
   nose of the plume are consistent with properties of an internal
   gravity current under rotation.

TI Numerical investigation of baroclinic instability in the Gaspe
   Current using a frontal geostrophic model
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB The Gaspe Current, situated in the western Gulf of St.
   Lawrence, is an intense, buoyancy-driven jet, which is fed by
   freshwater runoff from the St. Lawrence River. This coastal
   current is known to exhibit frequent episodes of instability,
   culminating in backward breaking waves as well as filaments and
   eddies. We investigate the observed mesoscale variability in a
   series of numerical simulations, employing a two-layer frontal
   geostrophic model that focuses on baroclinic dynamics. Unlike
   previous studies, we allow for large-amplitude variations of
   the interface depth, with the possibility of outcroppings, as
   well as two-way coupling of the dynamic pressures in each
   layer. It is found that the growth rates and length scales
   associated with the early evolution of disturbances compare
   favorably with those observed. Moreover, the mesoscale features
   resulting from highly nonlinear interactions closely resemble
   those seen in satellite data.

TI The Siberian Coastal Current: A wind- and buoyancy-forced
   Arctic coastal current
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB We describe circulation and mixing in the Siberian Coastal
   Current (SCC) using fall shipboard measurements collected
   between 1992 and 1995 in the western Chukchi Sea. The SCC,
   forced by winds, Siberian river outflows, and ice melt, flows
   eastward from the East Siberian Sea. It is bounded offshore by
   a broad (similar to 60 km) front separating cold, dilute
   Siberian Coastal Water from warmer, saltier Bering Sea Water.
   The alongshore flow is incoherent, because the current contains
   energetic eddies and squirts probably generated by frontal
   (baroclinic) instabilities. These enhance horizontal mixing and
   weaken the cross-shore density gradient along the SCC path.
   Eventually, the SCC converges with the northward flow from
   Bering Strait, whereupon it deflects offshore and mixes with
   that inflow. Deflection occurs where the alongshore pressure
   gradient vanishes. That location varies on synoptic and
   seasonal timescales, because this gradient depends on the
   winds, buoyancy fluxes, and the sea level difference between
   the Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Deflection usually occurs on the
   Chukchi shelf, but the SCC occasionally flows southward through
   Bering Strait. Such events are short lived (1-10 days) and
   occur mainly in fall and winter under northerly winds. SCC
   transport is likely small (similar to 0.1 Sv), but its dilute
   waters could substantially freshen the Bering Strait inflow and
   affect the disposition of Pacific waters in the Arctic Ocean.
   Arctic river outflows should preferentially form surface-
   advected fronts rather than bottom-advected fronts because
   vertical-mixing energy is low on arctic shelves. Surface-
   advected fronts are more susceptible to upwelling winds (and
   for the SCC, the pressure gradient between the Pacific and
   Arctic Oceans) than bottom-advected fronts. The SCC never
   developed in fall 1995 because of anomalously steady upwelling
   winds. The western Chukchi shelf could have formed upper
   halocline source water in the winter of 1995-1996.

TI Circulation and boundary layers in differentially heated
   rotating stratified fluid
SO DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
AB Recent laboratory experiments with rotating stratified water in
   a cylinder have revealed many of the predictions of linearized,
   analytic theory. Earlier measurements of the velocity field
   generated in a cylinder by top heating compared well with
   theory. Large stratification clearly suppressed Ekman pumping
   so that the interior velocity field (primarily azimuthal)
   responded by satisfying no-slip top and bottom boundary
   conditions without the need for Ekman layers. This interior
   flow also occupied a boundary layer of greater thickness than
   the Ekman layer under some conditions. Theory and experiments
   have now been conducted for sidewall heating. As before,
   experiment and theory agree well over some parameter ranges.
   But for some parameters, the flow is unstable. The exact nature
   of the instability remains poorly understood. The size of one
   combination of both vertical and horizontal boundary layers is
   governed by the Rossby radius of deformation multiplied by the
   square root of the Prandtl number. Sidewall boundary layers and
   their scales will be reviewed with the present results in mind.

TI The wind driven currents on the Middle Atlantic Bight inner
   shelf
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB A set of month-long current meter data from two moorings
   deployed at the 20 and 30 m isobaths to the southeast of
   Atlantic City, New Jersey are examined to characterize the
   structure of the wind-induced subtidal currents in the Middle
   Atlantic Eight under summer time conditions. The wind stress
   and currents are dominated by variability at the 2-4 d time
   scales. The majority of the wind stress variance is oriented in
   the along-shelf direction (35 degrees T), but the subtidal
   currents at both moorings also show substantial across-shelf
   variability, with the standard deviation of the across-shelf
   current component exceeding 50% of that of the along-shelf
   current component. Furthermore, there is an appreciable
   reduction in magnitude and a change in orientation of the
   subtidal current vector with depth. The currents from the
   mooring located at the 30 m isobath are significantly coherent
   with the wind stress, with surface current rotating clockwise
   and bottom current rotating anticlockwise of the wind. With an
   upwelling favorable wind, there is a significant offshore flow
   in the upper layer and an onshore flow in the lower layer,
   consistent with Ekman transport. The situation reverses with a
   downwelling favorable wind. The depth-averaged current is
   dominated by variability in the along-shelf direction. Wind
   stress and along-shelf surface slope are the leading terms in
   the depth-integrated along-shelf momentum balance, but bottom
   stress also plays an important role in the balance. The
   currents at the inner shelf mooring (20 m isobath) are much
   less coherent with the wind, particularly for the surface
   current. The reduced linear correlation between the wind and
   the observed subtidal current there may be caused by the
   influence of the buoyancy-driven coastal current originating
   from the Hudson River estuary to the north of the mooring site.

TI On the variability in the vertical structure of the Delaware
   coastal current
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB Previous studies have concluded that a distinctive feature of
   the buoyancy-driven Delaware coastal current lies in the fact
   that the coastal current extends to the bottom and flows next
   to the heavier shelf water rather than on top of it. The
   present study examines two sets of observations conducted in
   1990 and 1992. The 1990 observations are consistent with
   previous findings, but the 1992 survey shows that the Delaware
   coastal current forms a clear surface layer on top of the shelf
   water. The wind does not provide an adequate explanation for
   the discrepancy between the two surveys, as downwelling
   favorable winds were present during both periods. The
   differences in the dyer discharge also appear inadequate in
   explaining the variability observed. The data suggest that the
   variation in the tidal mixing characteristics associated with
   the spring-neap modulation may contribute to the observed
   differences between the two cruises. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

TI The seasonal and subtidal variability in the source region of
   the Delaware coastal current
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB Current meter data obtained off the mouth of Delaware Bay in
   the spring and autumn of 1984 are used to characterize the
   seasonal and subtidal variability in the source region of the
   Delaware coastal current. There are several major features of
   the coastal current which are common between dhe two seasons.
   At the mooring site the structure of the mean current indicates
   estuarine outflow from surface-to-bottom. The magnitude of the
   mean flow decreases and the direction of the mean flow veers
   further downshelf to the south and SSW with increasing depth.
   The water column is nor vertically well-mixed, and a surface-
   to-bottom salinity difference of about 2 exists for both
   seasons. Local wind does nor appear to be the dominant factor
   responsible for producing the subtidal current fluctuations,
   especially at very low frequencies (<0.1 cycles day(-1)). The
   current vectors are only coherent with the clockwise rotating
   part of the wind vector. In addition to these major features
   which occur in both seasons, there are major differences as
   well. The magnitude of the mean flow decreases by a factor of
   two and the mean salinity increases by about 2 from spring to
   autumn, probably in response to the seasonal cycle in the
   Delaware River discharge. During autumn, the subtidal currents
   show coherent fluctuations throughout the water column, and
   these currents are essentially rectilinear and aligned in the
   same direction. During spring, the current variance along the
   semiminor axis is more significant and there is an appreciable
   difference in the principal axis direction between the surface
   and the bottom. In spring, the current and salinity show
   coherent fluctuations at frequencies lower than 0.1 cycles
   day(-1). These low frequency fluctuations are apparently caused
   by earlier river discharge events. The lag between the major
   river discharge events and the very low-frequency variations in
   salinity is about 3 weeks. In autumn, the current and salinity
   are significantly coherent at subtidal frequencies higher than
   0.2 cycles day(-1). The intratidal salinity variability is
   substantially larger in spring than in autumn. The strength of
   the buoyant outflow in spring produces an enhanced horizontal
   salinity gradient, which in turn results in an increase in the
   intratidal salinity variability relative to that in autumn.
   This result suggests that the tidal variability in salinity can
   be strongly influenced by the non-linear interactions with the
   subtidal variability in the Delaware coastal current. (C) 1998

TI The effect of wind direction and mixing upon the spreading of a
   buoyant plume in a non-tidal regime
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB A three-dimensional baroclinic model, incorporating an accurate
   density advection scheme, and a range of turbulence closure
   models which can account for wind-wave turbulence at the sea
   surface, is used to examine the horizontal spreading and
   vertical mixing of a surface buoyant plume under a range of
   idealized wind stresses and bottom topography variations.
   Initial calculations show that the spread of the plume and its
   vertical mixing are very sensitive to the values of vertical
   viscosity and diffusivity. These coefficients are initially
   determined with a two-equation turbulence energy model,
   although subsequent calculations show that similar results can
   be obtained using a one equation model provided suitable
   stability functions are chosen for viscosity and diffusivity.
   Calculations assuming a constant water depth show that the
   offshore spread of the plume is greatest from an along shore
   upwelling favourable wind which gives rise to an offshore
   spread as a surface buoyant jet. An along shore downwelling
   favourable wind slightly reduces the offshore spread. In the
   case of a sloping bottom the offshore extent is reduced by the
   bottom slope, with the surface wind driven flow being a maximum
   in the near shore region. The magnitude of the surface current
   is sensitive to assumed values of the surface roughness length,
   and in the region of the plume shows a significant spatial
   variability due to a combination of a surface wind driven flow
   and that produced by the plume outflow. Suggestions as to how a
   proposed experiment involving a shore based HF Radar and a
   salinity survey in the region of the Ebro plume may be used to
   validate a physically realistic model of the region are made.

TI A model study of the seasonal circulation in the Gulf of Maine
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The Princeton Ocean Model is used to study the circulation in
   the Gulf of Maine and its seasonal transition in response to
   wind, surface heat flux, river discharge, and the M-2 tide. The
   model has an orthogonal-curvature linear grid in the horizontal
   with variable spacing from 3 km nearshore to 7 km offshore and
   19 levels in the vertical. It is initialized and forced at the
   open boundary with model results from the East Coast Forecast
   System. The first experiment is forced by monthly
   climatological wind and heat flux from the Comprehensive Ocean
   Atmosphere Data Set; discharges from the Saint John, Penobscot,
   Kennebec, and Merrimack Rivers are added in the second
   experiment; the semidiurnal lunar tide (M-2) is included as
   part of the open boundary forcing in the third experiment. It
   is found that the surface heat flux plays an important role in
   regulating the annual cycle of the circulation in the Gulf of
   Maine. The spinup of the cyclonic circulation between April and
   June is likely caused by the differential heating between the
   interior gulf and the exterior shelf/slope region. From June to
   December the cyclonic circulation continues to strengthen, but
   gradually shrinks in size. When winter cooling erodes the
   stratification, the cyclonic circulation penetrates deeper into
   the water column. The circulation quickly spins down from
   December to February as most of the energy is consumed by
   bottom friction. While inclusion of river discharge changes
   details of the circulation pattern, the annual evolution of the
   circulation is largely unaffected. On the other hand, inclusion
   of the tide results in not only the anticyclonic circulation on
   Georges Bank but also modifications to the seasonal
   circulation.

TI Mesoscale currents on the inner New Jersey shelf driven by the
   interaction of buoyancy and wind forcing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Shipboard hydrographic and acoustic Doppler current profiler
   surveys conducted in August 1996 on the New Jersey inner shelf
   revealed a buoyant intrusion advancing southward along the
   coast. This buoyant intrusion originated from the Hudson
   estuary more than 100 km upshelf and appeared as a bulge of
   less saline water with a sharp across-shelf frontal zone at ifs
   leading edge. During this time, the study area was also forced
   by a brief upwelling-favorable wind event opposing the
   direction of buoyant flow propagation. The interaction of
   buoyancy and wind forcing generated a spatially variable
   velocity field. In particular, across-shelf currents were
   comparable to their alongshelf counterparts. Variability in the
   alongshelf direction occurred on the scales of the order of the
   baroclinic Rossby radius. intensive across-shelf currents
   reached speeds of 20-40 cm s(-1) and appeared as spatially
   localized mesoscale flows with a width of O(10 km). They were
   generated at the leading edge of the buoyant intrusion and
   persisted over the period of observations, slowly propagating
   southward along with the buoyant flow. They were essentially
   baroclinic with strong vertical sheer and were further
   amplified by the wind forcing. The upwelling-favorable wind
   event also generated cyclonic circulation within the buoyant
   intrusion, which has not been observed before. Interaction of
   the opposing wind and buoyancy forcings deformed the pycnocline
   into a dome. This dome was effectively isolated from wind-
   induced turbulent mixing by overlying buoyant water, The
   adjustment of the velocity field to this density disturbance
   occurred geostrophically, even though the water depth was only
   20-30 m and friction was important. Relative vorticity
   associated with this cyclonic flow was at least 0.3f.
