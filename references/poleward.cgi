TI On the origin of the warm inflow to the Nordic Seas
SO PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Warm and saline waters enter the Nordic Seas from the south as
   part of the warm-to-cold water transformation of the
   thermohaline circulation of the northern North Atlantic. One
   explanation for the origin of the Nordic Seas Inflow is a
   "shallow source hypothesis" under which the Inflow waters are a
   modification of upper ocean subtropical waters. Warm waters
   from the subtropical gyre are carried to the eastern North
   Atlantic by the North Atlantic Current and branch northwards,
   joined by poleward upper thermocline flow along the upper
   continental slope, to provide the Nordic Seas Inflow. Along
   this pathway the upper water column is progressively cooled and
   freshened by winter convection, the subpolar mode water
   transformation process, and this sets the Inflow
   characteristics. A "deep source hypothesis" provides an
   alternative explanation for the characteristics of the Nordic
   Seas Inflow and the pathway delivering the waters to the
   Inflow. Under this hypothesis Inflow waters originate from the
   core of the Mediterranean Overflow Waters in the Gulf of Cadiz
   carried northward at mid-depth by the eastern boundary
   undercurrent in the subtropics, continuing into the subpolar
   gyro along the eastern boundary, and rising from depths near
   1200 m in the Rockall Trough to less than 600 m to cross the
   Wyville-Thomson Ridge into the Faroe-Shetland Channel and
   thence to the Nordic Seas. The deep source hypothesis focus is
   on lower thermocline source waters beneath the sill depth for
   the Nordic Seas Inflow, in contrast to the shallow source
   hypothesis focus of transformation of upper thermocline waters
   above the sill depth. On the basis of regional water mass
   distributions, geostrophic shear, and direct current
   measurements, we reject the deep source hypothesis in favor of
   the shallow source hypothesis. Rather than a flow of deep
   Mediterranean Overflow Water along the eastern boundary rising
   from depth to feed the Nordic Seas, the Inflow is supplied
   directly by transformed North Atlantic Current waters from the
   same depth range as the Inflow. Mediterranean Overflow Water is
   a constituent of the Inflow, but only through its contribution
   to defining the temperature-salinity relationship of the
   interior of the subtropical gyro from which the North Atlantic
   Current draws its water, rather than by direct northward
   advection of Mediterranean Outflow Water via the eastern
   boundary undercurrent crossing from the subtropics into the
   subpolar domain. Instead, the eastern boundary undercurrent
   wholly expels its transport of Mediterranean Overflow Water
   into the eastern edge of the subtropical gyro, creating the
   mid-depth westward extending subtropical salinity plume. For
   the lower thermocline isopycnal range of the core of the
   Mediterranean Overflow Water, measurements show that at the
   Wyville-Thomson Ridge the flow is southward and descending
   (rather than northward and rising), representing cold spillover
   from the Faroese Channels entraining warm upper ocean waters as
   the spillover plume descends and warms into the northern
   Rockall Trough. No evidence is found in Rockall Trough
   northward of 54 degreesN (Porcupine Bank) for direct advection
   of Mediterranean Overflow Waters via an eastern boundary
   undercurrent extension, and the very dilute Mediterranean
   Overflow Waters in the Trough reflect the interaction of the
   Wyville-Thomson Ridge plume descending into the Trough from the
   North, and lower thermocline waters delivered to the Trough
   from the south. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

TI A numerical study of the seasonal variability in the
   circulation off central Chile
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB The Princeton Ocean Model is used to study the coastal ocean
   circulation off central Chile (between 30 degrees and 45
   degreesS) and its seasonal transitions in response to monthly
   mean climatological wind stress and surface heat flux. The
   model reproduces many of the dominant circulation features,
   including an equatorward coastal current, coastal upwelling,
   and a poleward undercurrent. To get the correct seasonal
   variability in the undercurrent, it was necessary to prescribe
   the inflow of the undercurrent on the northern model boundary.
   Meanders and eddies form throughout the simulation period
   seaward of the coastal current in response to baroclinic
   instability of the flow. The flow associated with the meanders
   shows upwelling in the shoreward flow and downwelling in the
   seaward flow. This upwelling/downwelling pattern is explained
   by conservation of relative vorticity in the flow. The
   upwelling velocity associated with the meanders corresponds to
   a vertical migration of 15-30 m over a typical timescale of the
   meanders of 1-2 months. It is argued that this upwelling may be
   important for maintaining observed high phytoplankton biomass
   and primary production seaward of the coastal zone directly
   affected by wind-driven upwelling.

TI Physical structures, advection and mixing in the region of
   Goban spur
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The physical context for ocean margin exchange at Goban Spur is
   described. Observations adjacent to, prior to and during the
   Ocean Margin EXchange (OMEX) project of 1993-1996 are used.
   They include currents measured on moorings, drogued-buoy
   tracks; temperature and other data from CTD profiles,
   especially as indicators of vertical mixing; evidence from
   models, particularly for turbulence causing vertical mixing.
   These data are combined in estimates of (seasonally dependent)
   mean flow, tidal currents, other current variability, exchange
   and mixing over the main cross-slope section studied in OMEX
   and in nearby and contrasted locations (aided by the use of
   earlier and adjacent measurements). Causative physical
   processes are discussed: potentially northward flow along the
   continental slope, effects of Goban Spur topography, eddies,
   wind-driven transport, cascading, tides, fronts, internal
   tides, internal waves, surface waves. Among these, there is
   evidence that the along-slope flow, typically O(0.05ms(-1)), is
   reduced or even reversed in spring, is generally weaker than at
   some other margin sectors owing to the non-meridional alignment
   and indentations in the Celtic Sea slope, and may sometimes
   overshoot rather than follow the depth contours around Goban
   Spur; tidal currents are O(0.2ms(-1)) on the adjacent shelf but
   O(0.1ms(-1)) or less over most of Goban Spur; they increase to
   the southeast; other (wind- and eddy-forced) contributions to
   the currents are typically O(0.1ms(-1)) or less, except on the
   shelf, and decrease with depth; wind-, tide- and wave-forced
   currents are probably the most consistent agents of cross-slope
   exchange O(1m(2)s(-1)), with topographic effects being
   important locally (canyons, spurs); stratification starts
   intermittently until early June, becomes shallower through June
   and deepens by September. In 1995, one storm on 5-8 September
   roughly doubled the upper mixed-layer depth to > 40m and
   reinstated maximal primary production in the upper mixed layer;
   vertical mixing is intermittent, dominated by surface inputs
   (wind and waves); towards the southeast, internal waves of
   tidal origin are increasingly important for mixing across the
   thermocline; in the context of nutrient provision for primary
   production in the upper mixed layer, diffusion through the
   summer thermocline appears to be small unless internal waves
   strongly increase mixing. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

TI An unusual two layered tidal circulation induced by
   stratification and wind in the Ria of Pontevedra (NW Spain)
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB A two-layered tidal circulation pattern has been observed in
   the Ria of Pontevedra at an anchored station (24 rn deep)
   located at 42.3917 degreesN and 8.7380 degreesW. During a tidal
   cycle water leaves the estuary continuously through surface
   layers (till 8-12 m depth) and enters the estuary through
   bottom layers. This unusual pattern in a partially mixed
   estuary is observed to depend on the particular summer
   stratification conditions and on the presence of easterly winds
   inside the estuary. The vertical stratification is generated by
   solar heating and favourable upwelling conditions on the
   adjacent shelf, which reinforces the estuarine positive
   circulation and provokes the inflow of typical upwelling water
   (ENAW) through bottom layers. On the other hand, the easterly
   winds inside the estuary are strong enough (around 8 m s (-1))
   to force the surface water to move, even against tide. This
   situation is compared to two typical patterns observed in the
   estuary, a winter situation where wind drives the surface water
   against tidal forcing and a spring situation where the water
   column follows the tidal pattern. In both cases, bottom layers
   are hardly influenced by wind forcing. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

TI On the role of the Azores Current in the ventilation of the
   North Atlantic Ocean
SO PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Three high-resolution ocean circulation models of the North
   Atlantic, differing chiefly in their description of the
   vertical coordinate, are used to examine the ventilation of the
   North Atlantic subtropical gyre. All the models produce mode
   waters of realistic densities in the Sargasso Sea and the
   European Basin, but have Azores Currents of differing
   strengths, which are categorised as strong (of realistic
   transport), intermediate, and weak. These differences have a
   critical impact upon the ventilation of the gyre. Most
   importantly, the strong Azores Current forms an effective
   barrier to the southward ventilation of Eastern North Atlantic
   Water from the northern European Basin, initially driving it
   southwestwards into the central gyre, before turning it back
   eastwards again in a general cyclonic circulation north of the
   Current. The intermediate and weak Azores Currents instead
   allow the southward ventilation of this water mass near the
   European and African coasts. The situation in Nature appears to
   be intermediate between these two cases, with the Azores
   Current acting as a partial block. The study also raises the
   possibility of the Azores Current forming an advective
   connection between the Sargasso Sea Mode Waters in the western
   basin and modes of similar densities found in the eastern basin
   on the southern side of the Current. Although there are high
   levels of variability in the extent of these lighter modes in
   the eastern basin in Nature, this postulate is supported by a
   number of observational studies. In addition, the present study
   also provides some support for the local production of Madeira
   Mode Water in the eastern basin, associated with retroflecting
   current branches on the southern side of the Azores Current.
   Overall, the Azores Current is, therefore, likely to have a
   critical impact upon the ventilation of the subtropical gyre
   over a large area, rather than just locally, affecting the
   potential vorticity and density structure of the upper ocean
   between subtropical latitudes and the northern European Basin.
   The study also contributes to an ongoing community effort to
   assess the realism of our current generation of ocean models.

TI On the origin and pathway of the saline inflow to the Nordic
   Seas: insights from models
SO PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The behaviours of three high-resolution ocean circulation
   models of the North Atlantic, differing chiefly in their
   description of the vertical coordinate, are investigated in
   order to elucidate the routes and mechanisms by which saline
   water masses of southern origin provide inflows to the Nordic
   Seas. An existing hypothesis is that Mediterranean Overflow
   Water (MOW) is carried polewards in an eastern boundary
   undercurrent, and provides a deep source for these inflows.
   This study, however, provides an alternative view that the
   inflows are derived from shallow sources, and are comprised of
   water masses of western origin, carried by branches of the
   North Atlantic Current (NAC), and also more saline Eastern
   North Atlantic Water (ENAW), transported northwards from the
   Bay of Biscay region via a 'Shelf Edge Current' (SEC) flowing
   around the continental margins. In two of the models, the MOW
   flows northwards, but reaches only as far as the Porcupine Bank
   (53 degreesN). In third model, the MOW also invades the Rockall
   Trough (extending to 60 degreesN). However, none of the models
   allows the MOW to flow northwards into the Nordic Seas.
   Instead, they all support the hypothesis of there being shallow
   pathways, and that the saline inflows to the Nordic Seas result
   from NAG-derived and ENAW water masses, which meet and
   partially mix in the Rockall Trough. Volume and salinity
   transports into the southern Rockall Trough via the SEC are, in
   the various models, between 25 and 100% of those imported by
   the NAG, and are also a similarly significant proportion (20-
   75%) of the transports into the Nordic Seas. Moreover, the
   highest salinities are carried northwards by the SEC (these
   being between 0.13 and 0.19 psu more saline at the southern
   entrance to the Trough than those in the NAG-derived waters).
   This reveals for the first time the importance of the SEC in
   carrying saline water masses through the Rockall Trough and
   into the Nordic Seas. Furthermore, the high salinities found on
   density surfaces appropriate to the MOW in the Nordic Seas are
   shown to result from the wintertime mixing of the saline near-
   surface waters advected northwards by the SEC/NAG system.
   Throughout, we have attempted to demonstrate the extent to
   which the models agree or disagree with interpretations derived
   from observations, so that the study also contributes to an
   ongoing community effort to assess the realism of our current
   generation of ocean models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

TI Flow structure and seasonality in the Hebridean slope current
SO OCEANOLOGICA ACTA
AB The intensity, structure and variability of the slope current
   have been determined from 16 months of observations with
   Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and conventional
   current meters on a cross-slope section at the Hebridean shelf
   edge during the Shelf Edge Study (SES) programme. After removal
   of the tidal signals, the mean flow over the upper slope is
   found to be closely parallel to the topography with speeds of
   approximate to 20 cm.s(-1). The flow extends down to a depth of
   500 m and is predominantly barotropic, especially in winter
   when the flow is practically uniform between 350 m and the
   surface. In summer, there is a significant baroclinic component
   with a pronounced maximum in current at a depth of about 200 m
   but more than 80% of the kinetic energy is in the barotropic
   component. Flow in the core of the current is highly persistent
   with the Neumann's steadiness St > 0.8 in summer. In winter the
   flow is generally more energetic and variable and extends onto
   the adjacent shelf. The cross-slope profile of sea surface
   elevation, computed from the mean barotropic currents, shows a
   consistent relation to seabed topography through the seasonal
   cycle. Long-term averages of the cross-slope components are
   generally small (approximate to 2 cm.s(-1)) with some
   indication of persistent down-slope flow in the bottom Ekman
   layer. Measurements with shipboard ADCP on sections at
   intervals along the slope show a high degree of continuity in
   the structure of the flow. The core of the flow appears to be
   related to a weak positive salinity anomaly and a depression of
   the 9.5 degreesC isotherm near the shelf, but there is no
   strong correlation between the core of the slope-current and
   the core of the salinity anomaly. It is proposed that this may
   be due to differences in the cross-stream diffusion of salt and
   momentum which have different boundary conditions at the slope.
   The observed cross-stream structure of the current supports the
   hypothesis that JEBAR is the principal forcing mechanism but
   the result cannot be regarded as conclusive since a uniform
   potential vorticity model of the flow produces a similar cross-
   sectional structure of the current. (C) 2001

TI On the influence of Mediterranean Water on the Central waters
   of the North Atlantic Ocean
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB Within the Central waters of the North Atlantic Ocean there is
   a significant east-west difference in salinity, similar to that
   caused by Mediterranean Water at deeper levels. In this paper
   we hypothesize that the salinity of the Central Water is
   influenced by the saline Mediterranean Outflow Water, despite
   physical separation of the two water masses by a salinity
   minimum over most of the ocean basin. It is suggested that
   there occurs a cross-isopycnal flux of salinity from the
   Mediterranean Outflow Water towards the low-density Central
   Water (detrainment) in the eastern Gulf of Cadiz, not far from
   the Strait of Gibraltar, where the two water masses are in
   physical contact. Laboratory experiments, inverse modeling and
   direct current observations are applied to support the
   hypothesis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of meteorological and hydrographic disturbances on the
   microplankton community structure in the Ria de Vigo (NW Spain)
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
AB The relationships between meteorological and hydrographic
   disturbances and microplankton community structure and
   organisation were investigated in the Ria de Vigo, an estuarine
   ecosystem affected by coastal upwelling. The frequency and
   duration of sampling (ca twice per week from September 1990 to
   May 1992) are appropriate to reveal the impact of disturbances
   in the context of the seasonal cycle. Perturbations were
   identified statistically and related to recognisable
   meteorological and hydrographic processes that are expected to
   influence microplankton dynamics. According to the frequency of
   disturbances (between 8 and 14 yr(-1)) the ecosystem could be
   classified as intermediate-frequency disturbed in relation to
   the microplankton community organisation timescales.
   Meteorological and thermohaline disturbances promoted changes
   in microplankton community structure (disjunctions). The time-
   series of thermohaline properties, a proxy for allogenic
   processes related with mixing regimes and estuarine
   circulation, was the best indicator of changes in community
   structure: 15 out of the 21 disjunctions (ca 70%) coincided
   with thermohaline disturbances. Disturbances of the nutrient
   fields were related to allogenic forcing but also, markedly
   during the productive season, to re-structuring of the
   microplankton community. They pointed out autogenic community-
   driven processes. Microplankton assemblages revealed by the
   species-oriented ordination technique were interpreted in terms
   of the replication strategies: well-defined groups of
   competitor (C), disturbance-tolerant ruderal (R) and stress-
   tolerant (S) species were discerned. At a seasonal time-scale,
   succession progressed according to the sequence from r- to K-
   selection strategies. C-species dominated spring assemblages,
   during the period of transient thermoclines, while S-species
   contributed more to summer assemblages, when the thermocline
   was fully developed and the ecosystem was under nutrient
   stress. R-species showed an intermittent pattern and their
   relative abundance increased when environmental variability was
   more acute, during the winter and spring to summer (clear-water
   phase) transition. The regime of allogenic disturbances
   operating at intermediate frequency during the productive
   season allowed the maintenance of relatively high microplankton
   diversity at the functional (assemblage) level: all types of
   replication strategies were present during summer and early
   autumn. The results support the applicability of the
   intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) to microplankton
   community structure in the Ria de Vigo.

TI Wind and tidal influence on water circulation in a Galician ria
   (NW Spain)
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB The wind effect on water circulation was described by means of
   hydrodynamical and thermohaline measurements carried out in the
   ria of Pontevedra (NW Spain) from February to July 1998. The
   samples were measured both at an anchored station situated in
   the inner parr of the ria and at other stations located in the
   main channel. In this way, temporal and spatial events were
   related. Thermohaline variables (salinity and temperature) were
   used to clarify the current patterns measured at the anchored
   station. It has been observed that there is a clear
   predominance of wind in the main estuary axis direction. The
   wind direction is strongly dependent on topography. Wind speeds
   higher than 4 ms(-1) are able to dominate the current at
   surface layers, even against tidal effect. Easterly winds force
   water to leave the estuary at surface layers while westerly
   winds farce water to enter it. Diurnal breezes associated with
   westerly winds were rarely recorded. Bottom layers were
   controlled by tide, except during an upwelling event. (C) 2000

TI Comparisons between a fine resolution model and observations in
   the Iberian shelf-slope region
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB Results from a fine resolution model of the Iberian shelf-slope
   region are compared with data from cruises conducted in the
   same area. The agreement between the model and a cruise carried
   out in May 1993 is qualitatively good. The model is also able
   to represent the seasonal cycle in the area as revealed by
   cruises carried out in November 1993 and July/August 1994.
   Quantitative agreement between the model and the observations
   is less good and this is a result of limitations in the data
   used to force the model at the surface and the boundaries.
   Features of the circulation which are modeled well include
   seasonal coastal upwelling, the winter Portugal Coastal
   Countercurrent and the spreading of Mediterranean Water.
   Coastal upwelling occurs in summer and is enhanced off Cape
   Finisterre: and Cape Roca. The Portugal Coastal Countercurrent
   exists in the model as a poleward flow over the upper
   continental slops which is strongest in winter but persists
   throughout the year and in summer is seen as a weak sub-surface
   feature. Mediterranean Water spreads northwards in two cores
   with a distinct focussing towards the coast to the north of the
   Tagus Plateau. The particular form of open boundary conditions
   employed perform well with little evidence of false reflection
   of outgoing waves. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

TI Slope transport of suspended particulate matter on the
   Aquitanian margin of the Bay of Biscay
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Spatial and temporal characteristics of the water masses and
   the dispersion of the suspended particulate matter were
   investigated using current meter, hydrographic and
   nephelometric observations, gathered during the ECOFER
   experiment (1989-1991) in the Cap-Ferret Canyon on the
   Aquitanian margin of the Bay of Biscay, While characteristics
   of the deep water masses were stable from one year to another,
   large hydrographic change in the upper 500 m related to winter
   renewal induced by poleward advection of warm and saline water
   along the continental slope. The slope circulation and seasonal
   eddy activity appear as important dynamical mechanisms that
   control the entrainment and the dispersion of the suspended
   particulate matter from the neritic domain to the deep ocean. A
   predominantly northward along-slope current with occasional
   reversal characterizes this circulation. The nephelometric
   structures also showed seasonal changes in the overall
   suspended particulate matter content, but recurrent features,
   such as the presence of intermediate nepheloid layers at the
   shelf-break depth and various depths along the slope ( similar
   to 500, 1000 and 2000 m), were observed. These nepheloid layers
   extended off the slope to about 10-30 km, but especially
   laterally along the slope. Their presence indicated that
   suspended particulate matter exchanges between the shelf and
   the slope occurred mainly in the head of the canyon and along
   the southern open slope. The intermediate nepheloid layers
   around 500 m depth detached from the slope particularly in
   regions where the bottom slope is close to critical for the M-2
   internal tide. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   the continental slope current and its variability during
   winter. It is found that local wind forcing alone is
   insufficient to reproduce the observed mean transports, and
   that an external transport from the south must be added to
   match observations. The required external transport is of the
   same magnitude (1-2 Sv) as required by the JEBAR component
   (combined effect of bottom relief and stratification).
   Experiments driven by observed winter wind fields produce
   transport variability on time scales of days to weeks which is
   in line with observational evidence, suggesting that wind
   forcing is an important mechanism for the variability of the
   slope current transport. This supports the view of the slope
   current being driven by a combination of barotropic and
   baroclinic processes. A study of the model results in the
   remaining part of the computational domain reveals that the one
   active layer model is partly unable to reproduce many of the
   known current features in the area. This result is used to
   point to additional physical processes which should be included
   in a more complete model of the upper ocean circulation in the
   area. These are (1) barotropicity, (2) vertical resolution
   (more vertical layers) and variable upper layer temperature and
   salinity, to provide for baroclinic and frontal instability
   processes, (3) bottom relief acting through the barotropic
   mode, (4) imposed inflow along the slope in the south, and (5)
   a large scale flux of water and vorticity from the North
   Atlantic. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI OBSERVATIONS OF A POLEWARD-FLOWING SALINE CORE ON THE
   CONTINENTAL-SLOPE WEST OF SCOTLAND
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB A well-defined core of high salinity (>35.36 PSU) water was
   observed on the upper continental slope west of Scotland
   between August 1987 and February 1988 and it is identified with
   the poleward-flowing Scottish continental slope current. Core
   salinity decreased in the northward direction consistent with
   mixing with surrounding fresher waters. The core had theta-S
   characteristics of North Atlantic Central Water and lay close
   to the Eastern North Atlantic Water (ENAW) theta-S curve. This,
   therefore, excludes the alternative possibility that it is of
   Mediterranean origin.
