  title = {Eddy mean flow decomposition and eddy-diffusivity estimates in the
          tropical {Pacific} Ocean 1. Methodology},
  journal = {J. Geophys. Res.-Oceans},
  volume = 103,
  pages = {30855-30871},
  abstract = {The tropical Pacific Ocean surface current system can be
             characterized by a strong degree of nonstationarity due to the
             fast response time of equatorial and near-equatorial dynamics.
             The ocean-atmospheric dynamics create longitudinally coherent
             zonal flow (zonal length scales l(x) similar to 60 degrees) with
             strong meridional shear (l(y) similar to 1 degrees in latitude)
             in the large-scale mean and an energetic mesoscale (O(100 km))
             component. Parameterization of the effects of the mesoscale field
             depends on the separation of the large-scale mean from the
             observed velocity. In this paper the focus is placed on the key
             issue: separating the flow into large-scale mean and mesoscale
             eddy components in order to compute meaningful eddy diffusivity
             estimates in flow regimes that demonstrate strong currents and
             strong shear. Large gradients in the large-scale mean have
             precluded diffusivity estimation by traditional binning
             techniques. In this first of two publications, a method is
             developed for using Lagrangian data to estimate the diffusivity
             addressing the inhomogeneity of the mean flow. The spatially
             dependent estimate of the mean field is computed with a least
             squares bicubic smoothing spline interpolation scheme with an
             optimized roughness parameter which guarantees minimum energy in
             the fluctuation field at low frequencies. Numerical simulations
             based on a stochastic model of a turbulent shear flow are used to
             validate our approach in a conceptually simple but realistic
             scenario. The technique is applied to near-surface drifter
             observations obtained from 1979-1946 from two dynamically
             distinct time-space regions of the tropical Pacific Ocean. The
             first region, in the South Equatorial Current, is characterized
             by a linear zonal shear mean flow and an approximately
             exponential autocovariance structure in the residuals. The
             velocity residuals have velocity variance of (s) over cap(2) =
             130 cm(2) s(-2) for both components, and horizontal diffusivities
             are <(kappa)over cap>(u) approximate to 7 X 10(7) cm(2) s(-1) and
             <(kappa)over cap>(v) approximate to 3 X 10(7) cm(2) s(-1). No
             significant interannual variations of the estimates are detected,
             but residual trends in the estimators arise from intraseasonal
             variations in the velocity field during the 3-month season. The
             second region, in the North Equatorial Countercurrent and the
             North Equatorial Current, has a mean flow with a strong zonal
             shear and a weak northward velocity. The autocovariance is
             approximately exponential for the zonal component, while the
             meridional component has a negative lobe at about 10 days,
             probably due to the presence of instability waves. The variance
             is 380 cm(2) s(-2) for the zonal component and 360 cm(2) s(-2)
             for the meridional component, while the horizontal diffusivities
             are <(kappa)over cap>(u) approximate to 15 X 10(7) cm(2) s(-1)
             and <(kappa)over cap>(v) approximate to 4 X 10(7) cm(2) s(-1).
             Strong intraseasonal variability requires a maximum time window
             of 2 months for approximate stationarity to hold for the
             covariance calculations.}

             are 48 h of no data transmission followed by 24 h of received
             transmission (48-24 h). Also examined are duty cycles of 32-16 h
             and 16-8 h. It is found that the strong inertial motions
             prevalent in the drifter records result in significantly biased
             statistics derived from the degraded series. Reproduction of the
             original prime (mean and standard deviation) and rotary spectral
             statistics requires an interpolation that takes into account the
             oscillatory component of the drifter motions. Duty cycles having
             shorter but more frequent gaps (e.g., 16-8 h) are not sufficient
             to resolve the main features of the flow. The authors recommend
             that interpolations over duty cycle segments of drifter records
             be customized to account for the dominant modes of variability
             observed in available continuous segments.}

  volume = 46,
  pages = {2371-2403},
  abstract = {Statistics of the near-surface circulation in the northeast
             Pacific Ocean were derived from the trajectories of nearly 100
             surface drifters tracked between August 1990 and December 1995 as
             part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment's (WOCE) Surface
             Velocity Program (SVP). Drifters were drogued within the mixed
             layer (15 m drogue depth) or near the top of the permanent
             halocline (120 m). All branches of the Alaskan Gyre were
             well-sampled at both depths, revealing a weak Subarctic Current,
             a bifurcation of the Subarctic Current near 48 degrees N, 130
             degrees W at 15 m depth, and strong, variable how in the Alaska
             Current and Alaskan Stream. At 120 m depth, northward flow in the
             Alaska Current occurred much farther offshore than within the
             mixed layer. The drifter trajectories revealed interannual
             variability, with evidence of an intensified Alaskan Gyre during
             the winters of 1991-92 and 1992-93 and more southerly transport
             during winter 1994-95. A minimum in eddy kinetic energy was found
             at both depths within the northern branch of the Subtropical
             Gyre. Eddy kinetic energies were nearly twice as high in the
             mixed layer compared to below, and were 2-3 times larger in
             winter than in summer throughout most of the near-surface Alaskan
             Gyre. High eddy energies observed near the eastern perimeter of
             the Alaskan Gyre may be due to the offshore intrusion of eddies
             formed by coastal current instabilities. Taylor's theory of
             single-particle dispersion was applied to the drifter ensembles
             to estimate Lagrangian decorrelation scales and eddy
             diffusivities. Both the initial dispersion and random walk
             regimes were identified in the dispersion time series computed
             for several regions of both ensembles. The integral time scales
             and eddy diffusivities computed from the dispersion scale
             linearly with r.m.s. velocity, which is consistent with drifter
             studies from the Atlantic An exception is the meridional integral
             time scales, which were nearly constant throughout the study area
             and at both drogue depths. The magnitudes of the derived eddy
             statistics are comparable to those derived from surface drifters
             in other parts of the world ocean. These are the first Lagrangian
             estimates of particle dispersion over a broad region of the
             near-surface North Pacific, and the consistency of the results
             with previous studies from-the Atlantic lends credence to the
             idea that the simplifying assumptions of Taylor (1921)
             (Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society Series A 20,
             196-221) are reasonably valid throughout the upper ocean. This
             bodes well for the effective parameterization of near-surface
             diffusivities in general circulation models. Finally, the
             drifter-derived velocity statistics were used to speculate on the
             source regions of waters of possible coastal origin observed at
             offshore stations during the field studies of the Canadian Joint
             Global Ocean Flux Study. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science

             System during the period 1993-1994 in order to study mean and
             eddy currents. The deployment scheme allowed a 2 year period
             where data density was high enough to make meaningful estimates
             of eddy statistics and of seasonal mean currents and variances on
             a 5 degrees grid. Eddy variability, which tended to be isotropic,
             was higher near the coast (standard deviations around 0.2 m
             s(-1)) and decreased offshore (down to similar to 0.1 m s(-1)).
             Seasonal mean surface flow west of California was southward
             during all seasons: if a Davidson Current existed during
             1993-1995, it was probably either short-lived or only found
             closer to the coast than our study area, i.e., within 100-150 km
             of shore. In some cases, drifter populations within a discrete
             feature were high enough to allow some detailed resolution of its
             behavior. We note a tendency for individual eddies (which can
             last for up to 3-5 months) to drift westward at rates of O(5 km
             day-1). Not all eddies in the region are surface-intensified.
             There is clear evidence for at least the occasional presence of a
             thin, meandering southward jet in the region that can be 1000 km
             or more long. This jet can be identified with that found in the
             Coastal Transition Zone program in association with cool
             filaments. The jet appears to become broader and slower south of
             Point Conception. We hypothesize (on the basis of others' results
             as well as ours) that the eddies that are strongest at the
             surface result primarily from instabilities on a southward
             alongshore mean current and that eddies that are maximal at depth
             are spawned by the northward undercurrent.}

             satellitetracked drifters were deployed in or near cold filaments
             near Point Arena, California (39-degrees-N), and tracked for up
             to 6 months as part of the Coastal Transition Zone (CTZ) program.
             The drifters had large drogues centered at 15 m, and the
             resulting drifter trajectory data set has been analyzed in terms
             of its Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics. The CTZ drifter
             results show that the California Current can be characterized in
             summer and fall as a meandering coherent jet which on average
             flows southward to at least 30-degrees-N, the southern end of the
             study domain. From 39-degrees-N south to about 33-degrees-N, the
             typical core velocities are of O(50 cm s-1) and the current
             meanders have alongshore wavelengths of O(300 km) and
             onshore-offshore amplitude of O(100-200 km). The lateral movement
             of this jet leads to large eddy kinetic energies and large eddy
             diffusivities, especially north of 36- degrees-N. The initial
             onshore-offshore component of diffusivity is always greater than
             the alongshore component in the study domain, but at the southern
             end, the eddy diffusivity is more isotropic, with scalar single
             particle diffusivity (K(xx) + K(yy)) of O(8 x 10(7) cm-2 s-1).
             The eddy diffusivity increases with increasing eddy energy.
             Finally, a simple volume budget for the 1988 filament observed
             near 37-degrees-N off Point Arena suggests that subduction can
             occur in a filament at an average rate of O(10 m d-1) some 200 km
             offshore, thus allowing the cold water initially in the filament
             core to sink below the warmer ambient water by the time the
             surface velocity core has turned back onshore. This process
             explains why satellite temperature and color imagery tend to
             "see" only flow proceeding offshore.}

             slope is measured with ARGOS tracked drifters. Forty-two drifters
             drogued at 50 m were deployed in three circles over the Hebrides
             slope at 56.15 degrees N in two releases, one on 5th December,
             1995 and the second on 5-9th May, 1996. The circles span a
             distance of some 20 km from water depths of 200 m to 1200 m.
             Drifters are initially advected poleward alongslope by the
             Hebrides slope current at between 0.05 and 0.70 In s(-1) in a
             laterally constrained (25-50 km wide) jet-like flow. Drifters
             released in winter remained in the slope current for over 2000 km
             whilst summer drifters were lost from the slope current beyond
             the Wyville-Thomson Ridge, a major topographic feature at 60
             degrees N. Dispersion from the slope region into deeper waters
             occurs at bathymetric irregularities, particularly at the Anton
             Dohrn Seamount close to which the slope current is found to
             bifurcate, both in summer and winter, and at the Wyville-Thomson
             Ridge where drifters move into the Faeroe Shetland Channel.
             Dispersion onto the continental shelf occurs sporadically along
             the Hebrides slope. The initial dispersion around the Hebrides
             slope is remarkably sensitive to initial position, most of the
             drifters released in shallower water moving onto the shelf,
             whilst those in 1000 m or more are mostly carried away from the
             slope into deeper water near the Anton Dohrn SI:amount. The
             dispersion coefficients estimated in directions parallel and
             normal to the local direction of the 500 m contour, approximately
             the position of the slope current core, are approximately 8.8 x
             10(3) m(2) s(-1) and 0.36 x 10(3) m2 s(-1), respectively, during
             winter, and 11.4 x 10(3) m(2) s(-1) and 0.36 x 10(3) m(2) s(-1),
             respectively, during summer. At the slope there is a minimum in
             across-slope mean velocity, Reynolds stress, and across-slope
             eddy correlations. The mean across-slope velocity associated with
             mass flux is about 4x10(- 3) ms shelfward across the shelf break
             during winter and 2 x 10(-3):m s(-1) during summer. The drifters
             also sam-pled local patterns of circulation, and indicate that
             the source of water for the seasonal Fair Isle and East Shetland
             currents are the same, and drawn from Atlantic overflows at the

             through 1 degrees by 1 degrees boxes are derived for each of the
             three surfaces. Speed and kinetic energy decrease with depth,
             although directional stability is comparable at all levels. The
             axis of the NAG, which follows the 4000 m isobath along the
             western boundary, is described by mean kinetic energy (MKE)
             Values surpassing 100 cm(2) s(-2) on the float surfaces and
             correspond to regions with directional stabilities in excess of
             60\%. Maximum values of eddy kinetic energy are found just
             offshore of the maximum MKE associated with the NAC main pathway
             and decrease rapidly to the east. Two cyclonic meanders are
             identified at 44 degreesN, 45 degreesW near the Newfoundland
             Seamounts and at 46 degreesN, 42 degreesW near Flemish Cap. The
             main difference between the patterns derived for the surface
             drifters and floats was the greater eastward extent of the
             cyclonic trough st 44 degreesN and intensity of the Mann Eddy (42
             degreesN, 44 degreesW) during the float sampling period

             turbulence, and assimilation of velocity data from the
             surrounding drifters through a Kalman filtering technique. The

             number of drifters within a distance on the order of the Rossby
             radius of deformation from the particle to be predicted. The
             clusters are inherently different with respect to this
             characteristic property with values ranging from N-R < 0.5 to N-R
             greater than or equal to 2.0 over the analysis period, depending
             on the initial launch pattern of the clusters and the dispersion
             processes. The results indicate that during the period when N-R
             greater than or equal to 1, the assimilation of surrounding
             drifter data leads to an improvement of predicted trajectories
             with respect to those based on advecting the drifters with the
             mean flow. When N-R < 1, the drifters are too far apart to
             exhibit correlated motion, and the assimilation method does not
             lead to an improvement. The effects of uncertainties in the mean
             flow field and initial release position are discussed. The
             results are also compared to simple estimates of particle
             location by calculating the center of mass of the cluster. (C)

             completed between 1996-2000 as part of the World Ocean
             Circulation Experiment. We describe the construction of a
             self-consistent drifter climatology, present decadal-mean
             quasi-Eulerian velocity and EKE fields computed on a 1 degrees

             measurements. Detailed discussion of the inferred surface
             circulation is focused on three regions: (1) The Gulf Stream and
             North Atlantic Current, (2) the Labrador Sea and subpolar gyre,
             and (3) the Caribbean Sea. The swiftest drifter motions were
             found in the equatorial region and along the tropical,
             subtropical, and subpolar western boundaries. The maximum
             instantaneous speed determined from a single (qualitycontrolled
             and filtered) drifter observation was 273 cm s(-1) in the Gulf
             Stream southeast of Cape Cod. The highest EKE value in the North
             Atlantic (2790 cm(2) s(-2)) was found in the Gulf Stream just
             downstream of the New England Seamounts. Over most of the
             Atlantic basin, drifter-derived EKE values were found to be O(100
             cm(2)s(-2)) higher than corresponding values derived from
             satellite altimetry. In the Labrador Sea a region of sharply
             elevated EKE appears to be geographically related to the
             localized ejection of drifters (and by extension, mass and
             kinetic energy) from the energetic West Greenland Current between
             60 degrees and 62 degreesN. When compared to drifter measurements
             made in the late 1970s our results suggest (but do not
             statistically confirm) an enhancement and slight northward shift
             of the zonal Gulf Stream extension. Such a shift is consistent in
             sign with expectations based on observed interdecadal variations
             in wind stress and subtropical gyre potential energy associated
             with the North Atlantic Oscillation.}

             Outside the energetic Gulf Stream, subsurface timescales are
             relatively constant at depths from 700 m to 2000 m. Length scale
             and the characteristic eddy speed decrease with increasing depth

             upper several hundred meters of the Gulf Stream. It is suggested
             that this behavior is due to the Lagrangian sampling of the
             mesoscale field, in limits set by the Eulerian eddy scales and
             the eddy kinetic energy. In highenergy regions of the surface and
             near-surface North Atlantic, the eddy field is in the "frozen
             field'' Lagrangian sampling regime for which the Lagrangian and
             Eulerian length scales are proportional. However, throughout much
             of the deep ocean interior, the eddy field may be in the "fixed
             float'' regime for which the Lagrangian and Eulerian timescales
             are nearly equal. This does not necessarily imply that the deep
             interior is nearly linear, as fixed-float sampling is possible in
             a flow field of O(1) nonlinearity.}

             National Laboratory (LANL) Parallel Ocean Program (POP) model.
             The main purpose of the study was to statistically quantify the
             state of the surface circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean for
             this period and compare it with the equivalent modeled state.
             Diffusivities and time and length scales are anisotropic over
             most of the ocean basin, except in most of the subpolar regions.
             Typical time and length scales are 2-4 days and 20-50 km. Longest
             timescales are found in the energetically quiescent regions in
             the south and southeast sectors of the basin. The longest length
             scales are found in the energetic western boundary current
             system, the most dispersive region of the domain. In many
             respects the eddy- resolving model reproduced a surface

             An eddy-permitting POP simulation produced unrealistic time and
             length scales that were too long and too short relative to the

             fplane due to the Coriolis parameter's variation with latitude
             and the curvature of Earth's surface is analyzed by considering
             the temporal changes in the angular momentum. The latter plays
             the role of a dynamical variable of the model, replacing the
             zonal velocity component, and drag is modeled by Rayleigh
             friction. The steady transport, which on an f-plane is
             perpendicular to the applied wind stress, is recovered on the
             Earth as a special solution where the meridional velocity is
             time-independent. For zonal wind stress, the trajectory on Earth
             is simply a great circle that passes through the poles while for
             meridional wind stress the special solution can have a
             time-independent nonzero meridional component so the trajectory
             does not have to be purely zonal. This asymmetry between zonal
             and meridional wind stresses on the Earth is due to the Coriolis
             parameter's variation with latitude only-an effect that is
             completely neglected on the f-plane. For steady wind forcing, the
             dynamical system is three-dimensional and its fixed points are
             located at the latitudes of vanishing wind stress. In the
             drag-free case, when the curl of the wind stress does not vanish
             at the fixed points, these points are always unstable; namely
             there exists at least one repulsive direction in (the 3D) phase
             space, When drag is included, these steady states still prevail
             but become stable for realistic values of the wind forcing and
             drag. An additional steady state, located right on the equator,
             exists in this case and its zonal velocity attains a constant
             value determined by the balance between the applied stress and
             the drag force. Although drag is present, this steady state is
             unstable for negative wind stress (i.e. easterly winds) so any
             deviation from a purely westward, equatorial, trajectory will
             grow exponentially in time. Naturally, no similar instability of
             the steady states occurs on the f-plane. The curl of the zonal
             wind stress at the latitudes where the stress itself vanishes
             determines the trajectory of a water column originating there via
             the nonlinear interaction between the motion due to inertial
             oscillations and that due to the wind-forced changes of the
             angular momentum. Temporal or zonal dependence of the wind stress
             has a profound effect on the trajectories, especially near the
             unstable latitudes due to the increase in the dimensionality of
             the system that enables more complex trajectories, The present
             simple model can quantitatively reproduce the observed fast
             dispersal of nearby launched drifters with steady and smooth wind
             stress. It can also explain qualitatively the different spectra
             of clusters of drifters launched in two field experiments in the
             NE Pacific Ocean under similar winds and the highly variable
             angle between the wind and the observed trajectories of clusters
             of drifters.}

             the surface currents, at mesoto seasonal scales, are described in
             terms of Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics estimated from the
             low-pass filtered drifter velocities. Maps of mean currents,
             subtidal velocity variance and mean kinetic energies were
             produced using a 40-km averaging scale. The mean flow map
             confirms that the global cyclonic circulation in most of the
             Adriatic basin is broken into three re-circulation cells in the
             northern, central and southern sub-basins (the latter two being
             controlled by the bathymetry of the Jabuka and South Adriatic
             Pits, respectively). An isolated cyclonic gyre prevails near the
             head of the basin. Mean velocities in the cyclonic gyres can
             exceed 25 cm s(-1) in the coastal areas where the velocity
             variance is also maximum (reaching 500 cm(2) s(-2)). Values near
             2 X 10(7) cm(2) s(-1). 2 days and 18 km were obtained for the

             in the along-basin direction, respectively. In the across-basin
             direction, the statistics are typically 50\% of the above values.
             Geographical and seasonal variations of the Lagrangian statistics
             can be substantial. It was found that the fluctuating velocities
             (or the mesoscale eddies) have a preferential cyclonic sense of
             rotation. The gyres and the coastal currents are mostly
             prevailing in summer and fall. In winter and spring, they are
             less intense but the southern one tends to re-circulate more
             around the South Adriatic Pit. The mean eddy kinetic energy is
             maximum in winter and fall throughout the central and southern
             sub-basins. The drifters showed that the southeastward flow along
             the Italian Peninsula has a width varying between 45 and 70 km
             and a mean core speed of 25-35 cm s(-1). In the northern and
             central sub- basins, maximum velocities are found within 5-10 km
             off the coast in winter and spring. while a weaker maximum is
             seen more offshore (15-25 km) during the other seasons. In the
             southern Adriatic, the current is wider in summer, fall and
             winter, whereas in spring, it becomes thinner (maximum core speed
             near 10 km from shore and width of about 50 km). The maximum core
             speed is generally larger in summer than in winter. (C) 2001

  abstract = {We address two questions related to buoyant coastal discharge:
             (1) What agents control the delivery of estuarine fresh water to
             the shelf? (2) How is this fresh water mixed with shelf water?
             Our subject was the Delaware Coastal Current, the buoyancy driven
             current originating in the Delaware estuary. The delivery of
             freshwater to the shelf at subtidal frequencies is controlled by
             two forcing agents: upland freshwater discharge into the estuary
             and the component of the wind parallel to the estuarine axis. The
             mean current we observed in the source region showed a strong
             decline in speed and large counterclockwise veering with
             increased depth. These variations in the mean current are best
             explained by thermal wind shear. From the moored instrument
             records we found evidence that in the source region mixing events
             of several hours duration are common at tidal frequencies when
             the local Richardson number Ri drops to a minimum level below
             1/4. Furthermore, there is a pronounced modulation of this
             minimum level for Ri controlled by the action of coastal Ekman
             circulation. Data from the satellite-tracked drifters show the
             striking difference between the coastal current configuration
             during downwelling and upwelling events. During downwelling the
             flow is downshelf and weakly onshore with particle trajectories
             orthogonal to the mean horizontal salinity gradient. In contrast,
             during upwelling the flow is strongly offshore and somewhat
             upshelf with particle trajectories down the mean salinity
             gradient, implying rapid mixing of plume water with shelf water.
             Corresponding values for horizontal dispersion of plume water
             showed modest values for both the along-shelf and across-shelf
             directions under downwelling but a very large value for the
             across-shelf dispersion under upwelling. We conclude that wind
             stress, acting through the mediation of the strain field produced
             by coastal upwelling circulation, is the primary means for
             completing the mixing of fresh water within the plume with shelf
             water.}

  title = {The shallow overturning circulation of the {Indian} Ocean},
  journal = {Prog. Oceanogr.},
  volume = 53,
  pages = {57-103},
  abstract = {The Indian Ocean differs from the other two large oceans in not
             possessing an annual-mean equatorial upwelling regime. While the
             subtropical cells (STCs) of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
             connect subtropical subduction regimes with tropical upwelling
             via equatorward thermocline flows and coastal undercurrents, much
             of the upwelling in the Indian Ocean occurs in the coastal
             regimes of the northern hemisphere. Consequently, the counterpart
             of the STCs of the other oceans has to be a cross- equatorial
             cell connecting the southern subtropical subduction zone via the
             Somali Current with the upwelling areas off Somalia and Oman. The
             southward return flow is by interior Ekman transports. This
             annual-mean picture is accomplished by a dominance of the summer
             monsoon, during which only northern upwelling occurs, over the
             winter monsoon. Pathways of the thermocline flows related to the
             shallow overturning circulations are investigated here and
             estimates of subduction and upwelling are presented. From the
             observed mean northward flow of thermocline waters within the
             Somali Current and the interior southward cross-equatorial return
             flow the magnitude of the cross-equatorial cell is estimated at 6
             Sv, with part of the thermocline waters being supplied by the
             Indonesian Throughflow. From observations we estimate that the
             northern upwelling occurs dominantly through the offshore
             outflows of the Somali Current by the Southern Gyre and Great
             Whirl and to a lesser degree off Oman. However, we also present
             model results suggesting a much lower role of Somali upwelling
             and a significant contribution from open-ocean upwelling in
             cyclonic domes around India and Sri Lanka. An interesting aspect
             of the Indian Ocean cross-equatorial cell is the mechanism by
             which the Ekman transport crosses the equator. Typically, Ekman
             transports during the summer (winter) monsoon are southward
             (northward) on both sides of the equator, while mean meridional
             winds on the equator are in the respective opposite direction.
             Earlier model evidence had suggested that this type of forcing
             should lead to an equatorial roll with northward surface flow and
             southward subsurface flow during the summer monsoon and reverse
             orientation during the winter monsoon. Observational evidence is
             presented here, based on shipboard ADCP sections, moored stations
             and surface drifters, confirming the existence of the equatorial
             roll. It is strongly developed in the western Indian Ocean during
             the SW monsoon where the wind conditions for the roll are best
             met. While in the central Indian Ocean and during the winter
             monsoon the roll appears to be a more transient phenomenon,
             superimposed by equatorial-wave currents. The evidence further
             suggests that the roll is mostly confined to the surface-mixed
             layer and is, therefore, of little consequence for the meridional
             heat transport. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

             during July-August are apparent in the present data set. The
             comparison of drifter data with the seasonal mean dynamic
             topography (0/1000 db) shows that the surface circulation pattern
             inferred from dynamic topography does not always represent the
             surface currents in the Indian Ocean. Both compare well for the
             South Equatorial Current, the Equatorial Counter Current, and the
             southwestward current along the Indonesian Islands; they differ
             in the Bay of Bengal during the southwest monsoon, but are
             similar during the northeast monsoon. Maps of mean and eddy

  abstract = {A series of diffusion experiments using surface drifters were
             performed in the coastal waters of south-western Taiwan near a
             small estuary and around an island. Two stages or regimes of
             drifter dispersion can be identified for all experiments: a
             coherent regime in the beginning stage when the drifters remained
             clustered with little dispersion occurred, and a rapid-disperse
             regime in the latter stage when the separation of drifters grew
             to the order of a few kilometres. Our results show that near
             estuaries the extent of the dispersive influence is limited to
             the tidal excursion distance, and the dispersion coefficient is
             about 12 similar to 15 m(2) s(-1). On the other hand, the
             dispersion coefficient downstream of an island in a strong flow
             (similar to 1-5 in s(-1)) can reach a much larger value (45 m(2)
             s(-1)), which can be attributed to the enhanced mixing and
             transport processes due to island wakes. Theoretical scaling
             parameters for coastal water flows are also presented to predict
             the formation of island wakes. After applying three different
             methods to exclude the effects of shear flow, the turbulent
             diffusivities for our experiments amount to 0.2 similar to 5 m(2)
             s(-1). Analysis of the differential kinematic properties
             indicates that a close relationship exists among the dispersion,
             diffusion and the effect of shear flow. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

  abstract = {Buoy drift in the northern North Atlantic and adjacent seas was
             analyzed to study the surface-layer currents and wind forcing.
             Two drifters with drogues at depths of 10 and 75 metres were
             deployed in the Denmark Strait (DS) in August 1993. The buoys
             drifted in the East and West Greenland Currents (EGG and WGC) and
             in the ocean basins south of Greenland and Iceland. The drogue
             loss events of the drifters were estimated from the linear
             relationship between the drift and geostrophic wind velocities.
             The linear model produces a set of parameters describing the
             relationship between the drift and the wind These parameters were
             investigated to determine possible drogue loss events. The buoys
             seem to have lost their drogues near Cape Farewell in December
             1993. Currents were calculated with the linear model. Strong
             current velocities of 0.5 m/s with stable directions were
             obtained in the EGG, while the currents were weaker, around 0.05
             m/s, and the direction fluctuated more in the DS and the open
             ocean. The speed ratio between the windinduced drift and the
             geostrophic wind ranged from 0.6\% in the DS to around 1\% in the
             EGC for drogued drift, while it was about 1.6\% in the open ocean
             for non-drogued drift. The turning angle between the drift and
             the geostrophic wind fluctuated by some tens of degrees in
             coastal conditions, but was close to zero in the open ocean.
             According to the distribution of the relative drift directions,
             the drogued drift was directed with the wind 50\% of the time
             while the undrogued drift was directed with the wind 80\% of the

             about 3.5 time the kinetic energy contributed by meso-scale
             eddies (similar to42 cm(2)/s(2)). The eddies are mainly
             anticyclonic, with a typical diameter of about 45 km. In the
             centre of the eddies the magnitude of the relative vorticity
             amounts to several tenths of the planetary vorticity. The
             seasonal mean flow over the abyssal plain shows a magnitude
             (1.5-2cm/s) and a direction in agreement with the seasonal mean
             wind-driven Ekman drift. Over the continental slope a stronger,
             poleward slope current is observed in winter (similar to5 cm/s).

             feeding of the slope current from the interior of the ocean. In
             summer the slope current appears to be absent or equatorward. (C)
