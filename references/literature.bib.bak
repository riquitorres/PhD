  journal = {Deep-Sea Res. Part II-Top. Stud. Oceanogr.},
  volume = 47,
  pages = {783-810},
  abstract = {The coastal upwelling region near Cape Bianco, Oregon (43
             degrees N) off the west coast of the United States was studied
             using a towed CTD on SeaSoar, a shipboard acoustic Doppler
             current profiler (ADCP), satellite sea surface temperature maps
             and surface drifters during August 1995. The equatorward
             upwelling jet was inshore of the shelfbreak north of Cape Bianco,
             meandered gently offshore around the Cape, and then veered
             sharply offshore just to the south of the Cape. Analysis of
             vertical sections of density, velocity and "spiciness" confirmed
             the separation of an upwelling jet and front; the jet was
             followed from over the shelfbreak north of the Cape to 100 km
             offshore downstream of the Cape. The separating jet originates
             from the coastal upwelling jet leaving the shelf, but is
             augmented by an offshore branching of the poleward undercurrent.
             By combining information from ADCP streamfunction maps with
             analysis of hydrographic data, including distributions of the
             tracer-like quantity "spiciness", a conceptual model of the
             three-dimensional circulation near the Cape emerges. A mid-shelf
             upwelling jet encounters a coastal promontory then turns
             offshore, stretching and deepening as it crosses the continental
             margin. The jet then turns back shoreward (cyclonically) where
             the deepened equatorward flow encounters the top of the poleward
             undercurrent flowing along the continental slope. This causes a
             portion of the undercurrent to turn offshore to join and
             strengthen the equatorward transport in the separated jet.
             Throughout the separation process the coastal upwelling front and
             jet are continuous, robust features. Separation of a coastal
             upwelling jet is an important mechanism for cross-shelf transport
             from the coast to the deep ocean. Cape Bianco appears to be the
             northernmost point where an equatorward jet regularly separates
             from the coast to become an oceanic jet and thus serves as the
             northern boundary of the region where an intense meandering
             current, characteristic of the California Current System, is
             found offshore. Drifters released late in the upwelling season
             are swept offshore and equatorward near the Cape. interact with
             the spatially complex circulation associated with the separated
             jet, and then return to the continental margin with the seasonal
             reversal in winds and near-surface currents. (C) 2000 Elsevier

  abstract = {Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses were completed
             using 3 yr (fall 1993 through late-summer 1996) of 1.4-km
             resolution, satellite-derived sea-surface temperature (SST)
             imagery from a large domain that includes the Gulf of Maine,
             Georges Bank, southern New England and western Scotian shelves,
             and the adjacent slope water region located seaward of the 200m
             isobath. Prior to analysis, raw satellite-derived SST images were
             carefully cloud masked using automated and manual cloud detection
             techniques and then interpolated to a 7-km resolution grid using
             optimal interpolation (OI). OI resulted in 218 cloud-free,
             five-day-averaged SST fields, produced at five-day intervals for
             the study period. After removal of the 3 yr temporal mean SST at
             each gridpoint, a covariance EOF analysis of OI SST shows three
             significant modes, accounting for a total of 96.5\% of observed
             SST variance. A gradient EOF analysis also shows three
             significant modes, accounting for a total of 92.7\% of observed
             SST variance after removal of the spatial mean SST from each OI
             SST field. Covariance EOF modes 1 and 3 represent 92.2 and 1.3\%
             of observed SST variance, and depict rich spatial structure in
             the seasonal heating cycle and additional spatial variation in
             the seasonal heating cycle over the study domain, respectively.
             SST variability noted for covariance EOF mode 1 is largely
             related to local differences in the seasonal mixed- layer depth,
             with deeper mixed layers resulting from strong tidal mixing over
             offshore banks and shoals contrasting with more- shallow-mixed
             layers and seasonal density stratification caused by weaker tidal
             mixing over regions of greater bottom depth. Additional spatial
             differences in seasonal SST variability and noted in covariance
             EOF mode 3 are related to regional differences in seasonal
             thermohaline and density characteristics of surface waters across
             the Gulf of Maine. Regional surface water differences across the
             Gulf of Maine are caused by different phasing between annual
             cycles of vertical heat flux and inputs of low-salinity Scotian
             Shelf water in eastern Gulf of Maine during late winter and local
             freshwater runoff from rivers in western Gulf of Maine during
             late spring. Covariance EOF mode 2 represents 3.0\% of observed
             SST variance and describes interannual SST variability manifested
             by a cooling trend within the slope water region caused by a
             decrease in Gulf Stream warm-core ring activity during the study
             period. The gradient EOF analysis shows results that support and
             supplement the covariance EOF analysis by depicting the
             year-round nature of the SST gradient associated with the shelf
             break front (mode 1, 86.4\% of SST variance) and SST gradients
             arising from spatial variation in the seasonal heating cycle
             (modes 2 and 3, 4.3\% and 2.0\% of SST variance, respectively)
             and some degree of interannual variability as described for
             covariance EOF mode 2 (mode 3). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {The hydrographic, chemical and biological conditions observed
             during spring and summer upwelling events off the NW Iberian
             Peninsula are compared. Meteorological data showed that
             northeasterly winds were of similar magnitude during both
             cruises, whereas the effect of upwelling was more intense during
             the spring than during the summer since stratification was weaker
             in spring. In the two situations the recurrent upwelling centre
             off Cape Finisterre (43 degrees N, 9 degrees W) divided the study
             area into two provinces. The two provinces differ in the
             occurrence and intensity of winds and in the origin of the
             upwelled water. Eastern North Atlantic Central Water of subpolar
             origin (ENACW(P)) was recorded north of Cape Finisterre during
             the two events. South of the Cape, ENACW(P) was observed during
             the spring situation, whereas ENACW of subtropical origin
             (ENACW(P)) prevailed during the summer cruise. Despite the
             different thermohaline and chemical properties of these two
             varieties of ENACW(P) similar nutrient levels were found in the
             two provinces due to strong remineralisation processes on the
             southern shelf. In addition, slower horizontal circulation at the
             southern edge of the upwelling centre and the influence of four
             large embayments (the Rias Baixas) south of Cape Finisterre,
             favoured chlorophyll accumulation south of the upwelling centre,
             which has similarly been observed in other upwelling centres
             around the world. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

  journal = jpo,
  volume = 31,
  pages = {226-243},
  abstract = {Upwelling jets flow alongshore in approximate geostrophic
             balance with the onshore pressure gradient induced by coastal
             upwelling. Observations of such jets have shown that they often
             move offshore downstream of capes, leaving a pool of upwelled
             water inshore. Comparisons are made between this behavior and the
             hydraulic transition of a potential-vorticity-conserving coastal
             current as it passes a topographic anomaly at which it is exactly
             critical to long coastal-trapped waves. An analytic 1.5-layer
             model of coastal hydraulics with constant potential vorticity in
             each layer predicts flow fields (i.e., jet separation) in
             critical situations that resemble observations. When scales
             approximate Cape Blanco on the Oregon coast, separation occurs at
             a jet transport of around 0.76 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1), similar to
             observed transports. Time-dependent, semigeostrophic calculations
             suggest that, during an upwelling season, the jet would evolve
             from a weak flow, which was subcritical everywhere and symmetric
             about the cape, to an exactly critical state that made a
             transition from subcritical to supercritical structure at the
             head of the cape. The predicted flow field at critical transition
             consists of a narrow upwelling jet upstream of the cape that
             moves offshore and broadens at the cape. This critical state
             would be accompanied by a downstream jump back to subcritical
             conditions. Further upwelling-favorable winds would lead to
             transient waves that propagated upstream and downstream,
             modifying the upstream and downstream conditions and restoring
             criticality. Thus, the head of the cape exerts hydraulic control
             on the flow and prevents the jet transport from increasing above
             its critical level. Inherent in the hydraulic approach is the
             assumption that alongshore scales are large. For realistic
             alongshore scales, solutions modified by coastline curvature
             suggest that the convexity of the head of a cape slightly
             inhibits the transition to a strongly upwelled downstream state
             by increasing the required critical transport. In the presence of
             topographic features with finite alongshore scale, the hydraulic
             approach can be used to construct a flow field, although this
             flow field has an inherent error arising from the implicit
             assumptions regarding scales. Estimation of this error for
             topography representing Cape Blanco suggests that in places the
             cape is rather abrupt for hydraulic theory to be valid.}

             southeastward current at mid-shelf by the baroclinic response to
             combined wind and buoyancy forcing, and we show how this local
             forcing leads to annually occurring cold and low salinity
             tongues. Through term-by- term analyses of the temperature budget
             we describe the WFS temperature evolution in spring. Heat flux
             largely controls the seasonal transition, whereas ocean
             circulation largely controls the synoptic scale variability.
             These two processes, however, are closely linked. Bottom
             topography and coastline geometry are important in generating
             regions of convergence and divergence. Rivers contribute to the
             local hydrography and are important ecologically. Along with
             upwelling, river inflows facilitate frontal aggregation of
             nutrients and the spring formation of a high concentration
             chlorophyll plume near the shelf break (the so-called `Green
             River') coinciding with the cold, low salinity tongues. These
             features originate by local, shelf-wide forcing; the Loop Current
             is not an essential ingredient.}

  abstract = {Physical and biological fields in the coastal transition zone
             off northern California were measured during February, March, May
             and June 1987 in an extended alongshore region between 60 km and
             150 km offshore. The spring transition, as seen in coastal sea
             level and winds, occurred in mid-March. Surface variability
             during the two spring cruises was stronger and of larger scale
             than that seen during the two winter cruises. An
             equatorward-tending current, flowing along the boundary between
             low steric sea level inshore and high steric sea level offshore,
             dominated both the directly-measured (acoustic Doppler current
             profiler) and geostrophic current fields during spring. Current
             jets of comparable strength directed both offshore and onshore
             were seen off Cape Mendocino and Point Arena; these evolved
             significantly in the 3 weeks between cruises. Inshore of the
             current, properties associated with upwelled water were found
             near the surface, including low temperature and high salinity,
             nutrients and chlorophyll; offshore of the current, waters were
             warmer, less saline, lower in nutrients and more oligotrophic.
             Geostrophic and directly measured volume transports in the
             current were about 2-3 Sv. Isopycnals inshore of the spring
             upwelling front were displaced vertically by O(40-80 m) from
             their depths during the winter survey; these displacements
             extended deep into the water column and were largely independent
             of depth between 100 and 400 m. Surface mixed layers tended to be
             deep in winter and shallower inshore of the upwelling front in
             spring. A connection between the equatorward-tending frontal jet
             off northern California and the more well-studied California
             Current further south is suggested by the similarity of their
             transports and of their dynamic height values.}

             seasonal and the long-term components of the 1987-92 time series
             are analysed. The seasonal changes in thermohaline properties are
             forced by meteorological factors, but whereas temperature shows a
             well-defined annual cycle, salinity presents a higher frequency
             variation pattern due to the influence of upwelling-downwelling

             way through the seasons, so that characteristic and well-defined
             cycles are observed. The annual cycle of chlorophyll a shows a
             bimodal pattern, which corresponds with the development of the
             spring and autumn blooms. Long-term trends, have been observed
             for most of the variables. Salinity increased and temperature
             decreased both for surface and bottom series. There was no
             evidence of increasing eutrophication. Chlorophyll a
             concentration showed a decreasing trend. Observed long-term
             trends could be attributed to changes of the meteorological
             factors that operate through an increase in the estuarine
             residual circulation.}

             front and the associated southward jet. Counter-flows were
             detected both over the slope and at the inner-shelf. The
             southward current is surface intensified with maximum values of
             about 40 cm s-1 and diverges to the south of the observed area
             recirculating both onshore and offshore. Along the slope, a
             warmer and saltier poleward current interacts with the jet
             generating an anticyclonic eddy about the Aveiro Canyon. Possible
             mechanisms of topographic forcing and filament development in the
             zone are discussed. Inshore, a coastal current advects warmer
             water northward creating a second front at the inner-shelf. The
             surface layers to the coastal side of the upwelling front are
             dominated by a low salinity lens, which we proposed to name the
             Western Iberia Buoyant Plume (WIBP). The equatorward flow, the
             coastal current and the stratification input of the WIBP
             introduce strong complexity into the dynamics of this
             double-frontal upwelling system. The plume is stirred being
             partially advected to the south and offshore while entrained in
             the upwelling jet. On the shore side, the plume is advected to
             the north by the coastal counter-flow. A conceptual model of
             circulation is presented.}

             continuous over the 440 km meridional extent of the analysis
             region. Other portions of the flow show evidence of offshore
             turning, separation, and the formation of anti-cyclonic eddies.
             We also note that isopycnic potential vorticity from alongslope
             CTD stations during the NMFS survey appears to be a tracer for

  abstract = {Eight years of current data, 5.5 years of Eulerian current meter
             data and 2 years of Lagrangian data, are analysed in the context
             of seasonality along the continental slope margin of NW Europe,
             across shelfbreak flow and continental shelf flow. Long-term
             records from the continental slope at the similar to 1000 m depth
             contour on Goban Spur and Little Sole Bank Spur show maximum
             recorded currents in the range 39-43 cm s(-1), but typical
             maximum monthly mean values are similar to 10 cm s(-1) in the
             upper half of the water column. On the slope, the flow is
             predominantly poleward in the general alongslope direction with
             maximum flow in winter (December-January). The spur situation can
             result in four preferred directions of alongslope flow which due
             to topographic control is less evident near the sea floor (
             similar to 50 m up), where the flow is predominantly poleward.
             Equatorward upper layer flow tends to occur in the spring
             (March-April) period but can extend to the sea floor and into the
             summer period nearer the sea surface. Some seasonal signatures
             correlate with sea level anomalies seen in altimeter data in the
             continental slope and shelf region. May infrared remote sensing
             images show cool water separating from the upper slope ( similar
             to 1 km water depth contour) region of Goban Spur both in a WNW
             and SSW direction (i.e. the off-slope preferred flow directions)
             reflecting both poleward and equatorward flows. The seasonal
             results are discussed in terms of the SOMA
             (September-October/March-April) seasonal response. The long-term
             or near annual Eulerian residual mean flows were typically 2 cm
             s(-1) throughout the water column and poleward in the alongslope
             direction. The upper layer (30 m depth) shelf currents, similar
             to 30 km onshelf from the Goban Spur shelfbreak, were markedly
             onshelf with a Eulerian mean of 6 cm s(-1) over a 129-day period.
             A carefully prepared drogued Argos buoy (drogued at 45 m depth),
             and deliberately placed for subsequent along continental shelf
             margin movement, released a further 100 km onshelf, moved
             northward and parallel to the western Celtic shelfbreak towards
             the south of Ireland. Here the drogued buoy found the Valentia
             Coastal Current, passed west of Ireland on the mid-shelf, then
             along the continental shelfbreak (200 m contour) and through the
             LOIS SES site, reaching a maximum speed of 66 cm s(-1) (12 h
             average). The drogued buoy entered the Northern North Sea, north
             of the Shetland Isles, travelling a distance of similar to 1600
             km over a period of 5 months. Drogued buoys were deployed in the
             ocean and on the shelf. Overall, it is shown that the continental
             slope is an insulator for ocean shelf exchange but the ocean
             margin is a conductor for advective influences from the south.

  abstract = {Considered are possible links between mesoscale features and the
             presence of topographic and/or coastline irregularities off the
             Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, and what physical
             processes sustain the persistent filaments. The former is
             investigated by contrasting the results from two suites of three
             model runs differing only in the specification of topography and
             coastline irregularities and values assigned to key model
             parameters. In this a fairly simple 1 1/2-layer model is used.
             The latter is explored by use of an energy diagnostic scheme
             recently developed for multilayer models. On the basis of visual
             inspection and spectral analysis of the results, it is concluded
             that the physical processes leading to the formation, the
             separation distance, and the persistence of the filaments are
             largely independent of the presence of a variable topography and
             coastline irregularities. The role of the irregularities is to
             modify the qualitative appearance of the filaments and also to
             loosely anchor them to conspicuous topographic and/or coastline
             features. The variable topography alone modifies the appearance
             of the mesoscale structures and produces alongshore differences
             in the onset of instabilities, while coastline irregularities
             alone effectuate a delay in the onset of the initial small-scale,
             linearly unstable waves. The energy diagnosis reveals that the
             eddy kinetic energy linked to the filaments and other mesoscale
             structures is steadily extracted from the mean available
             gravitational energy via a combination of frontal instability and
             mixed frontalconventional baroclinic instability. This
             cyclogenesis is made possible through the maintenance of a strong
             lateral front in both density and upper layer thickness close to
             the coast. The frontogenesis, in turn, is sustained by the
             persistent upwelling-favorable wind forcing.}

             West Florida inner shelf during both upwelling and downwelling
             events showing assymmetric response. Assymmetry is mainly shown
             in the bottom boundary layer from the tilting of planetary
             voritcity and buoyancy torque. It is interesting! Inner shelf
             pressure gradient divergence from upwelling winds, geostrophic
             interior adjustment and bottom ekman layer occur in unison. Stop
             one and you affect all of them. By promoting or inhibiting bottom
             ekman layer through tilting and stratitification yo get the
             asymmetry in the magnitude and offshore extent of the responses
             to downwelling and upwelling favourable winds. Upwelling is
             promoted, onshore bottom ekman layer is promoted and there is an
             inherent retention mechanism in the shelf.}
