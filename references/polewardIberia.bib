	abstract    = {Over 30 years of hydrographic data from the northern
	  Chile (18 degreesS-24 degreesS) upwelling region are used to
	  calculate the surface and subsurface seasonal climatology extending
	  400 km offshore. The data are interpolated to a grid with
	  sufficient spatial resolution to preserve cross-shelf gradients and
	  then presented as means within four seasons: austral winter
	  (July-September), spring (October-December), summer (January-
	  March), and fall (April-June). Climatological monthly wind forcing,
	  surface temperature, and sea level from three coastal stations
	  indicate equatorward (upwelling favorable) winds throughout the
	  year, weakest in the north. Seasonal maximum alongshore wind stress
	  is in late spring and summer (DecemberMarch). Major water masses
	  of the region are identified in climatological T-S plots and their
	  sources and implied circulation discussed. Surface fields and
	  vertical transects of temperature and salinity confirm that
	  upwelling occurs year- round, strongest in summer and weakest in
	  winter, bringing relatively fresh water to the surface nearshore.
	  Surface geostrophic flow nearshore is equatorward throughout the
	  year. During summer, an anticyclonic circulation feature in the
	  north which extends to at least 200 m depth is evident in
	  geopotential anomaly and in both temperature and geopotential
	  variance fields. Subsurface fields indicate generally poleward flow
	  throughout the year, strongest in an undercurrent near the coast.
	  This undercurrent is strongest in summer and most persistent and
	  organized in the south (south of 21 degreesS), A subsurface oxygen
	  minimum, centered at similar to 250 m, is strongest at lower
	  latitudes. Low-salinity subsurface water intrudes into the study
	  area near 100 m, predominantly in offshore regions, strongest
	  during summer and fall and in the southernmost portion of the
	  region. The climatological fields are compared to features off Baja
	  within the somewhat analogous California Current and to
	  measurements from higher latitudes within the Chile-Peru Current
	  system.

	  600-km-wide band of high mesoscale variability found along the

	  mesoscale variability was larger than the mean flow, and the
	  spatial modes of variability as determined from empirical
	  orthogonal function analysis consisted of an alongshore mode, a
	  cross-shore mode, and a rotational mode. Observations made near the
	  continental slope (124 degrees W) were dominated by the poleward
	  flowing California Undercurrent, with mesoscale eddies and meanders
	  superposed. The nearshore eddy kinetic energy peaked in a band
	  centered around 60 days. Observations made at 128 degrees W, near
	  the offshore boundary between the energetic mesoscale band and the
	  "eddy desert" of the northeast Pacific, were characterized by small
	  means, fewer eddy events, and a peak in eddy kinetic energy at
	  120-180 days. The good horizontal resolution of the current meter
	  arrays allowed us to estimate the relative vorticity, horizontal
	  divergence, and Rossby number and therefore to evaluate the
	  relative strength and occurrence of anticyclones and cyclones. We
	  found the mesoscale eddy field to be strongly nonlinear, with
	  Rossby numbers ranging from 0.1 to 0.5. All of the eddies observed
	  at the offshore site were nonlinear, deep, warm anticyclones.
	  Shipboard hydrography revealed the origin of one of these
	  anticyclones to be the California Undercurrent, and this eddy
	  retained its strong anomalies after several months and several
	  hundred kilometers of propagation. Despite the lower incidence of
	  eddies as one moves west from the coast, the eddies that we
	  observed offshore provide evidence for propagation and transport of
	  properties from the coast to the central North Pacific across the

	  Larval B. argyrogaster occurs mainly below the thermocline and
	  reaches farther polewards than larval H. macrochir, which dwells

	  thought to submerge below the equatorward flows of the Canary
	  Current and Benguela Current, and to form the slope-undercurrents
	  of the Northwest and Southwest African upwelling systems. Larvae in

	  distribution in the subtropical or tropical Atlantic. Among these,
	  some species appear to be faunistically linked with the Iberian
	  continental slope or slope waters even farther south along the NE
	  Atlantic margin. It seems that these species reach their
	  north-eastern range by means of poleward-flowing currents. For
	  example, Calanoides carinatus has deep-living resting stages and
	  ascends to surface waters only during its reproductive period,
	  which is short at northern latitudes. Its main dwelling layers
	  along the west Iberian continental slope cover the poleward-flowing
	  undercurrent and the Mediterranean outflow water underneath. Part
	  of the poleward flow regime tends to follow the slope bathymetry,
	  i.e. it bends eastwards into the Bay of Biscay along northern
	  Spain. Another part separates from the continental slope at Cape
	  Finisterre and crosses the Bay of Biscay, approaching the
	  continental slope at about 47 degrees N, where it joins the
	  north-westward flowing slope currents again. Because of its
	  preference for the deeper layers during the long resting phase it
	  is assumed that resting C. carinatus drifts mainly with the
	  northward branch of the Mediterranean outflow water and penetrates
	  only slightly into the inner Bay of Biscay. In contrast, Calanus
	  helgolandicus has, on average, a shallower vertical distribution.
	  Reproductively active individuals occur in the surface layers off
	  western Iberia throughout the year. Here it drifts presumably
	  northwards during late autumn and winter, but is recirculated
	  southwards during late spring and summer. Due to advection with
	  both the intermediate undercurrent and the variable near-surface
	  currents, Calanus helgolandicus occurs more commonly in the inner
	  Bay of Biscay than C. carinatus. (C) Elsevier, Paris.}

	  which the thermohaline circulation either decreases or increases
	  with density contrast. In the latter case. contrary to the
	  traditional wisdom, the freshwater forcing amplifies the
	  circulation and there exists a thermally dominated equilibrium for
	  arbitrary intensity of freshwater forcing, Here, Stommel's famous
	  feedback between circulation and salinity contrast is changed from
	  a positive to a negative feedback. The interaction of such a
