TI Seasonal climatology of hydrographic conditions in the
   upwelling region off northern Chile
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Over 30 years of hydrographic data from the northern Chile (18
   degreesS-24 degreesS) upwelling region are used to calculate
   the surface and subsurface seasonal climatology extending 400
   km offshore. The data are interpolated to a grid with
   sufficient spatial resolution to preserve cross-shelf gradients
   and then presented as means within four seasons: austral winter
   (July-September), spring (October-December), summer (January-
   March), and fall (April-June). Climatological monthly wind
   forcing, surface temperature, and sea level from three coastal
   stations indicate equatorward (upwelling favorable) winds
   throughout the year, weakest in the north. Seasonal maximum
   alongshore wind stress is in late spring and summer (December-
   March). Major water masses of the region are identified in
   climatological T-S plots and their sources and implied
   circulation discussed. Surface fields and vertical transects of
   temperature and salinity confirm that upwelling occurs year-
   round, strongest in summer and weakest in winter, bringing
   relatively fresh water to the surface nearshore. Surface
   geostrophic flow nearshore is equatorward throughout the year.
   During summer, an anticyclonic circulation feature in the north
   which extends to at least 200 m depth is evident in
   geopotential anomaly and in both temperature and geopotential
   variance fields. Subsurface fields indicate generally poleward
   flow throughout the year, strongest in an undercurrent near the
   coast. This undercurrent is strongest in summer and most
   persistent and organized in the south (south of 21 degreesS), A
   subsurface oxygen minimum, centered at similar to 250 m, is
   strongest at lower latitudes. Low-salinity subsurface water
   intrudes into the study area near 100 m, predominantly in
   offshore regions, strongest during summer and fall and in the
   southernmost portion of the region. The climatological fields
   are compared to features off Baja within the somewhat analogous
   California Current and to measurements from higher latitudes
   within the Chile-Peru Current system.

TI Spatial and temporal characteristics of the mesoscale
   circulation of the California Current from eddy-resolving
   moored and shipboard measurements
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Moored observations of currents and temperatures made in the
   upper 600 m on eddy-resolving scales over a 2-year period are
   used to examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of the
   California Current mesoscale circulation. The observations were
   made at three principal longitudes: 124 degrees W, 126 degrees
   W, and 128 degrees W in the vicinity of Point Arena. They
   bracket the 600-km-wide band of high mesoscale variability
   found along the eastern boundary of the North Pacific. At all
   locations, the mesoscale variability was larger than the mean
   flow, and the spatial modes of variability as determined from
   empirical orthogonal function analysis consisted of an
   alongshore mode, a cross-shore mode, and a rotational mode.
   Observations made near the continental slope (124 degrees W)
   were dominated by the poleward flowing California Undercurrent,
   with mesoscale eddies and meanders superposed. The nearshore
   eddy kinetic energy peaked in a band centered around 60 days.
   Observations made at 128 degrees W, near the offshore boundary
   between the energetic mesoscale band and the "eddy desert" of
   the northeast Pacific, were characterized by small means, fewer
   eddy events, and a peak in eddy kinetic energy at 120-180 days.
   The good horizontal resolution of the current meter arrays
   allowed us to estimate the relative vorticity, horizontal
   divergence, and Rossby number and therefore to evaluate the
   relative strength and occurrence of anticyclones and cyclones.
   We found the mesoscale eddy field to be strongly nonlinear,
   with Rossby numbers ranging from 0.1 to 0.5. All of the eddies
   observed at the offshore site were nonlinear, deep, warm
   anticyclones. Shipboard hydrography revealed the origin of one
   of these anticyclones to be the California Undercurrent, and
   this eddy retained its strong anomalies after several months
   and several hundred kilometers of propagation. Despite the
   lower incidence of eddies as one moves west from the coast, the
   eddies that we observed offshore provide evidence for
   propagation and transport of properties from the coast to the
   central North Pacific across the California Current System.

TI Poleward transport of equatorial fish larvae in the Atlantic
   Eastern Boundary Current system
SO ARCHIVE OF FISHERY AND MARINE RESEARCH
AB Fish larval distributions support the hypothesis that East:
   Atlantic "upwelling" undercurrents are interconnected, and can
   entrain plankton from the Equatorial Undercurrents towards
   temperate latitudes. This conclusion is based on historic and
   recently collected data on the distribution of adults and
   larvae of mainly two equatorial, mesopelagic fish species
   Bathylagus argyrogaster and Hygophum macrochir and consistent
   with hydrographic data. Along the continental slope these
   larvae occur 440 to 920 km polewards of the reproductive ranges
   of their adults. Larval B. argyrogaster occurs mainly below the
   thermocline and reaches farther polewards than larval H.
   macrochir, which dwells mainly at thermocline depths. At
   tropical latitudes the larvae of both species occur frequently,
   and within a generally poleward flow. Immediately polewards of
   the Cape Verde Frontal Zone, and Angola-Benguela Frontal Zone,
   respectively, the larvae become rare and more deeply
   distributed. At these fronts the poleward flows are thought to
   submerge below the equatorward flows of the Canary Current and
   Benguela Current, and to form the slope-undercurrents of the
   Northwest and Southwest African upwelling systems. Larvae in
   these undercurrents reach minimum latitudes of 22 degrees N and
   23 degrees 30'S. At the poleward flanks of East Atlantic
   cyclonic gyres, such as the Guinea Dome, Central Mauritanian
   Gyre, and Angola Dome, retroflections of the poleward current
   systems occur, also entraining and transporting larvae
   offshore.

TI The boundary circulation along the European continental slope
   as transport vehicle for two calanid copepods in the Bay of
   Biscay
SO OCEANOLOGICA ACTA
AB The copepod fauna south-west of the British Isles includes a
   number of species which have their centre of distribution in
   the subtropical or tropical Atlantic. Among these, some species
   appear to be faunistically linked with the Iberian continental
   slope or slope waters even farther south along the NE Atlantic
   margin. It seems that these species reach their north-eastern
   range by means of poleward-flowing currents. For example,
   Calanoides carinatus has deep-living resting stages and ascends
   to surface waters only during its reproductive period, which is
   short at northern latitudes. Its main dwelling layers along the
   west Iberian continental slope cover the poleward-flowing
   undercurrent and the Mediterranean outflow water underneath.
   Part of the poleward flow regime tends to follow the slope
   bathymetry, i.e. it bends eastwards into the Bay of Biscay
   along northern Spain. Another part separates from the
   continental slope at Cape Finisterre and crosses the Bay of
   Biscay, approaching the continental slope at about 47 degrees
   N, where it joins the north-westward flowing slope currents
   again. Because of its preference for the deeper layers during
   the long resting phase it is assumed that resting C. carinatus
   drifts mainly with the northward branch of the Mediterranean
   outflow water and penetrates only slightly into the inner Bay
   of Biscay. In contrast, Calanus helgolandicus has, on average,
   a shallower vertical distribution. Reproductively active
   individuals occur in the surface layers off western Iberia
   throughout the year. Here it drifts presumably northwards
   during late autumn and winter, but is recirculated southwards
   during late spring and summer. Due to advection with both the
   intermediate undercurrent and the variable near-surface
   currents, Calanus helgolandicus occurs more commonly in the
   inner Bay of Biscay than C. carinatus. (C) Elsevier, Paris.

TI Freshwater forcing as a booster of thermohaline circulation
SO TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Making use of a simple two-layer model, we analyze the impact
   or freshwater forcing on the thermohaline circulation. We
   consider the forward-type circulation dominated by thermal
   forcing, implying that the freshwater forcing acts to reduce
   the density contrast associated with the equator-to-pole
   temperature contrast prescribed in the model. The system is
   described by two variables: the depth of the upper layer (H)
   and the density contrast between the upper and lower layer
   Delta rho, which decreases with salinity contrast. The rate of
   poleward flow of light Surface water and the diapycnal flow
   (i.e.. upwelling) driven by widespread small-scale mixing are
   both modeled in terms of H and Delta rho Steady states of
   thermohaline circulation are found when these two flows are
   equal. The representation of the diapycnal flow {M-D} is
   instrumental for the dynamics of the system. We present equally
   plausible examples of a physically based representation of M-D,
   for which the thermohaline circulation either decreases or
   increases with density contrast. In the latter case. contrary
   to the traditional wisdom, the freshwater forcing amplifies the
   circulation and there exists a thermally dominated equilibrium
   for arbitrary intensity of freshwater forcing, Here, Stommel's
   famous feedback between circulation and salinity contrast is
   changed from a positive to a negative feedback. The interaction
   of such a freshwater boosted thermohaline circulation with the
   climate system is fundamentally, different from what is
   commonly assumed, an issue which is briefly addressed.

TI A forcing mechanism for the poleward flow off the southern
   California coast
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB It is shown that when the wind distribution along a coast is
   anisotropic, such that its cross-shore scale is smaller than
   its alongshore scale, the coastal sea level (or the upper layer
   anamoly) "A" of an ocean forced by both wind and wind curl is
   governed by a modified (nondimensionalized) Kelvin wave
   equation: partial derivative A/partial derivative t* + partial
   derivative A/partial derivative y* = k(0)(0, y*, t*) + integral
   partial derivative k(1)/partial derivative y* dt(L) where k(0)
   and k(1) are wind stress and wind stress curl at the coast,
   respectively, y is the alongshore distance, and t is the time.
   Numerical experiments, from a simple reduced-gravity type with
   idealized forcing and coastline to a three-dimensional
   primitive equation model with a realistic coastline, bottom
   topography of the Southern California Eight and the Santa
   Barbara Channel, and observed wind stresses, were carried out
   to show that the observed near-coast near-surface poleward flow
   in the region is primarily forced by the equatorward weakening
   of the wind curl, (partial derivative k(1)/partial derivative
   y* >0), in the bight. Beta provides natural damping by
   weakening and widening the current through westward propagating
   Rossby waves and causes the current to lead the coastal
   pressure field by 1-2 months, which improves the agreement with
   observations of the phasing of the modeled currents but is
   otherwise not required in forcing the poleward flow.

TI Comparisons between a fine resolution model and observations in
   the Iberian shelf-slope region
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB Results from a fine resolution model of the Iberian shelf-slope
   region are compared with data from cruises conducted in the
   same area. The agreement between the model and a cruise carried
   out in May 1993 is qualitatively good. The model is also able
   to represent the seasonal cycle in the area as revealed by
   cruises carried out in November 1993 and July/August 1994.
   Quantitative agreement between the model and the observations
   is less good and this is a result of limitations in the data
   used to force the model at the surface and the boundaries.
   Features of the circulation which are modeled well include
   seasonal coastal upwelling, the winter Portugal Coastal
   Countercurrent and the spreading of Mediterranean Water.
   Coastal upwelling occurs in summer and is enhanced off Cape
   Finisterre: and Cape Roca. The Portugal Coastal Countercurrent
   exists in the model as a poleward flow over the upper
   continental slops which is strongest in winter but persists
   throughout the year and in summer is seen as a weak sub-surface
   feature. Mediterranean Water spreads northwards in two cores
   with a distinct focussing towards the coast to the north of the
   Tagus Plateau. The particular form of open boundary conditions
   employed perform well with little evidence of false reflection
   of outgoing waves. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

TI Phytoplankton size-structure, particulate and dissolved organic
   carbon production and oxygen fluxes through microbial
   communities in the NW Iberian coastal transition zone
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
AB Contrasting hydrographic regimes were studied in the NW Iberian
   coastal transition zone in order to gain understanding of the
   relationship between planktonic community structure, production
   and loss rates, by concurrently measuring size-fractionated
   phytoplankton biomass and carbon incorporation as well as
   dissolved organic carbon production and dark respiration by
   microbial communities. Sampling was carried out in August 1998
   and October 1999 at a series of stations representing vertical
   stratification and coastal upwelling conditions in summer, and
   vertical mixing and shelf-break poleward flow situations during
   the autumn. A close relationship was found between size-
   fractionated phytoplankton biomass and production, the relative
   allocation of total photosynthesis to dissolved and particulate
   organic carbon fractions, and the balance between production
   and respiration. Picoplankton-dominated communities showed net
   heterotrophic metabolism and were associated with relatively
   high rates of DOC production with respect to total carbon
   incorporation (> 15%). In contrast, in coastal upwelling
   stations, where > 2 mum cells dominated, less than 10% of total
   fixed carbon flowed to DOC, and the net metabolism of the
   microbial plankton community was autotrophic.
