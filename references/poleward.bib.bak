	 dependent on topography. Wind speeds higher than 4 ms(-1) are able to
	 dominate the current at surface layers, even against tidal effect.
	 Easterly winds force water to leave the estuary at surface layers while
	 westerly winds farce water to enter it. Diurnal breezes associated with
	 westerly winds were rarely recorded. Bottom layers were controlled by
	 tide, except during an upwelling event. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

	 inflow of typical upwelling water (ENAW) through bottom layers. On
	 the other hand, the easterly winds inside the estuary are strong
	 enough (around 8 m s (-1)) to force the surface water to move, even
	 against tide. This situation is compared to two typical patterns
	 observed in the estuary, a winter situation where wind drives the

	 the water column follows the tidal pattern. In both cases, bottom

	 combined in estimates of (seasonally dependent) mean flow, tidal

	 cross-slope section studied in OMEX and in nearby and contrasted locations
	 (aided by the use of earlier and adjacent measurements). Causative
	 physical processes are discussed: potentially northward flow along the
	 continental slope, effects of Goban Spur topography, eddies, wind-driven
	 transport, cascading, tides, fronts, internal tides, internal waves,
	 surface waves. Among these, there is evidence that the along-slope

	 is generally weaker than at some other margin sectors owing to the
	 non-meridional alignment and indentations in the Celtic Sea slope, and may
	 sometimes overshoot rather than follow the depth contours around
	 Goban Spur; tidal currents are O(0.2ms(-1)) on the adjacent shelf but
	 O(0.1ms(-1)) or less over most of Goban Spur; they increase to the
	 southeast; other (windand eddy-forced) contributions to the currents are
	 typically O(0.1ms(-1)) or less, except on the shelf, and decrease with
	 depth; wind-, tide- and wave-forced currents are probably the most
	 consistent agents of cross-slope exchange O(1m(2)s(-1)), with topographic
	 effects being important locally (canyons, spurs); stratification starts
	 intermittently until early June, becomes shallower through June and deepens
	 by September. In 1995, one storm on 5-8 September roughly doubled
	 the upper mixed-layer depth to > 40m and reinstated maximal primary
	 production in the upper mixed layer; vertical mixing is intermittent,
	 dominated by surface inputs (wind and waves); towards the southeast,
	 internal waves of tidal origin are increasingly important for mixing
	 across the thermocline; in the context of nutrient provision for
	 primary production in the upper mixed layer, diffusion through the
	 summer thermocline appears to be small unless internal waves strongly
	 increase mixing. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The behaviours of three high-resolution ocean circulation
	 models of the North Atlantic, differing chiefly in their description
	 of the vertical coordinate, are investigated in order to elucidate
	 the routes and mechanisms by which saline water masses of southern
	 origin provide inflows to the Nordic Seas. An existing hypothesis is
	 that Mediterranean Overflow Water (MOW) is carried polewards in an
	 eastern boundary undercurrent, and provides a deep source for these
	 inflows. This study, however, provides an alternative view that the
	 inflows are derived from shallow sources, and are comprised of water
	 masses of western origin, carried by branches of the North Atlantic
	 Current (NAC), and also more saline Eastern North Atlantic Water
	 (ENAW), transported northwards from the Bay of Biscay region via a
	 'Shelf Edge Current' (SEC) flowing around the continental margins. In
	 two of the models, the MOW flows northwards, but reaches only as
	 far as the Porcupine Bank (53 degreesN). In third model, the MOW
	 also invades the Rockall Trough (extending to 60 degreesN). However,
	 none of the models allows the MOW to flow northwards into the Nordic
	 Seas. Instead, they all support the hypothesis of there being shallow
	 pathways, and that the saline inflows to the Nordic Seas result from
	 NAG-derived and ENAW water masses, which meet and partially mix in the
	 Rockall Trough. Volume and salinity transports into the southern
	 Rockall Trough via the SEC are, in the various models, between 25
	 and 100\% of those imported by the NAG, and are also a similarly
	 significant proportion (2075\%) of the transports into the Nordic Seas.
	 Moreover, the highest salinities are carried northwards by the SEC
	 (these being between 0.13 and 0.19 psu more saline at the southern
	 entrance to the Trough than those in the NAG-derived waters). This
	 reveals for the first time the importance of the SEC in carrying saline
	 water masses through the Rockall Trough and into the Nordic Seas.
	 Furthermore, the high salinities found on density surfaces appropriate to
	 the MOW in the Nordic Seas are shown to result from the wintertime
	 mixing of the saline near- surface waters advected northwards by the
	 SEC/NAG system. Throughout, we have attempted to demonstrate the extent
	 to which the models agree or disagree with interpretations derived
	 from observations, so that the study also contributes to an ongoing
	 community effort to assess the realism of our current generation of
	 ocean models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	 16 months of observations with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers
	 (ADCP) and conventional current meters on a cross-slope section at the
	 Hebridean shelf edge during the Shelf Edge Study (SES) programme.
	 After removal of the tidal signals, the mean flow over the upper
	 slope is found to be closely parallel to the topography with speeds
	 of approximate to 20 cm.s(-1). The flow extends down to a depth of
	 500 m and is predominantly barotropic, especially in winter when
	 the flow is practically uniform between 350 m and the surface. In
	 summer, there is a significant baroclinic component with a pronounced
	 maximum in current at a depth of about 200 m but more than 80\% of
	 the kinetic energy is in the barotropic component. Flow in the core
	 of the current is highly persistent with the Neumann's steadiness
	 St > 0.8 in summer. In winter the flow is generally more energetic
	 and variable and extends onto the adjacent shelf. The cross-slope
	 profile of sea surface elevation, computed from the mean barotropic
	 currents, shows a consistent relation to seabed topography through the
	 seasonal cycle. Long-term averages of the cross-slope components are
	 generally small (approximate to 2 cm.s(-1)) with some indication of
	 persistent down-slope flow in the bottom Ekman layer. Measurements with
	 shipboard ADCP on sections at intervals along the slope show a high
	 degree of continuity in the structure of the flow. The core of the
	 flow appears to be related to a weak positive salinity anomaly and a
	 depression of the 9.5 degreesC isotherm near the shelf, but there is no
	 strong correlation between the core of the slope-current and the
	 core of the salinity anomaly. It is proposed that this may be due to
	 differences in the cross-stream diffusion of salt and momentum which have
	 different boundary conditions at the slope. The observed cross-stream
	 structure of the current supports the hypothesis that JEBAR is the
	 principal forcing mechanism but the result cannot be regarded as
	 conclusive since a uniform potential vorticity model of the flow
	 produces a similar crosssectional structure of the current. (C) 2001
