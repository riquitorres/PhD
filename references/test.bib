@ARTICLE{-Weisberg/3,
	author	    = {He, R. and Weisberg, R. H.},
	title	    = {West Florida shelf circulation and temperature 
	   budget for the 1999 spring transition},
	journal     = {Continental Shelf Research},
	year	    = {2002},
	volume	    = {22},
	pages	    = {719-748},
	abstract    = {Mid-latitude continental shelves undergo a spring
	transition as the net surface heat flux changes from cooling to
	warming. Using in situ data and a numerical circulation model we
	investigate the circulation and temperature budget on the West
	Florida Continental Shelf (WFS) for the spring transition of 1999.
	The model is a regional adaptation of the primitive equation,
	Princeton Ocean Model forced by NCEP reanalysis wind and heat flux
	fields and by river inflows. Based on agreements between the
	modeled and observed fields we use the model to draw inferences on
	how the surface momentum and heat fluxes affect the seasonal and
	synoptic scale variability. We account for a strong southeastward
	current at mid-shelf by the baroclinic response to combined wind
	and buoyancy forcing, and we show how this local forcing leads to
	annually occurring cold and low salinity tongues. Through term-by-
	term analyses of the temperature budget we describe the WFS
	temperature evolution in spring. Heat flux largely controls the
	seasonal transition, whereas ocean circulation largely controls the
	synoptic scale variability. These two processes, however, are
	closely linked. Bottom topography and coastline geometry are
	important in generating regions of convergence and divergence.
	Rivers contribute to the local hydrography and are important
	ecologically. Along with upwelling, river inflows facilitate
	frontal aggregation of nutrients and the spring formation of a high
	concentration chlorophyll plume near the shelf break (the so-called
	`Green River') coinciding with the cold, low salinity tongues.
	These features originate by local, shelf-wide forcing; the Loop
	Current is not an essential ingredient.
