TI Secondary circulation associated with a shelfbreak front
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Evidence for secondary circulation associated with a shelfbreak
   front is obtained from a high-resolution, cross-shelf section
   of hydrographic, optical and velocity fields. Convergence in
   the bottom boundary layer on the inshore side of the front and
   subsequent upwelling into the interior is evident by a mid-
   water region of suspended bottom material emanating from the
   foot of the front and extending to within 35 m of the surface,
   80 m above bottom. Downwelling on the offshore side of the
   front in the upper water column is inferred from a 20-m
   downward bend of the subsurface phytoplankton layer. These
   observations are in agreement with recent model predictions for
   secondary circulation near an idealized shelfbreak front.
   Convergence in measured cross-shelf velocity at the foot of the
   front is consistent with upwelling of bottom material detected
   there. An estimate of 9+/-2 m day(-1) of upwelling on the
   inshore side of the shelfbreak front is obtained, implying a
   transit time from the bottom to the surface of 10-16 days.

TI Continuity of the poleward undercurrent along the eastern
   boundary of the mid-latitude north Pacific
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Several recent data sets improve our view of the poleward
   undercurrent of the California Current System. As part of a
   triennial National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) survey of
   Pacific whiting, a series of 105 shipboard acoustic Doppler
   current profiler (ADCP) velocity sections across the shelf
   break from 33 to 51 degrees N at about 18 km meridional spacing
   were collected from July to August 1995. Significant (> 0.05
   ms(-1)) subsurface poleward flow occurred in 91% of the
   sections. A mean cross-shelf section using the entire data set
   has statistical significance, revealing an undercurrent core >
   0.1 ms(-1) from 200-275 m depth 20-25 km off the shelf break.
   The mean poleward volume transport in a 125-325 m layer is 0.8
   +/- 0.2 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1). We focus particular attention on
   the Cape Blanco to Cape Mendocino region, and the NMFS results
   are compared with shipboard ADCP three weeks later from a study
   of coastal upwelling processes near Cape Blanco. ADCP
   streamfunction maps are derived and strongly suggest that one
   portion of flow is continuous over the 440 km meridional extent
   of the analysis region. Other portions of the flow show
   evidence of offshore turning, separation, and the formation of
   anti-cyclonic eddies. We also note that isopycnic potential
   vorticity from alongslope CTD stations during the NMFS survey
   appears to be a tracer for the poleward how. (C) 2000 Elsevier

TI Improving acoustic Doppler current profiler accuracy with wide-
   area differential GPS and adaptive smoothing of ship velocity
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
AB Accurate ship velocity is important for determining absolute
   currents from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP)
   measurements. In this paper, the authors describe the
   application of two methods to improve the quality of ship
   velocity estimates. The first uses wide-area differential
   global positioning system (WADGPS) navigation to improve ship
   positioning. During the cruise, raw global positioning system
   (GPS) pseudorange data are collected. The pseudorange
   measurement is the difference between satellite transmission
   time and receiver reception time of a GPS signal. A few days
   after the cruise, satellite clock corrections from the Canadian
   Active Control System and orbital parameters from the U.S.
   Coast Guard Navigation Center are used to derive WADGPS
   positions that remove the position degradation effects of
   selective availability. Two-dimensional root-mean-square (rms)
   position accuracies reduce from +/-34 to +/-9 m. The authors'
   second method of improving the ship velocity applies an
   adaptive local third-order polynomial smoother to the raw ship
   velocities. This smoothing method is particularly effective at
   handling the nonstationary nature of the signal when the ship
   is starting, stopping, or turning, which is typical of
   oceanographic cruises. Application of the smoother in this case
   reduces overall rms noise in the ship velocity by 16%. The
   combination of both methods reduces the uncertainty due to
   navigation of a 20-min ADCP absolute velocity from +/-0.063 to
   +/-0.038 m s(-1)-a 40% reduction. These methods also improve
   the calibration for sensitivity error and ADCP-gyrocompass
   misalignment angle.

TI DYNAMICS OF THE COASTAL TRANSITION ZONE JET .1. LINEAR-
   STABILITY ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB The linear stability of a coastal transition zone (CTZ) jet is
   analyzed using a six-layer quasi-geostrophic model with
   observed basic state velocity profiles.  The velocity profiles
   are obtained from objectively analyzed hydrographic and
   acoustic doppler data from the 1987 CTZ pilot experiment.
   Along-jet perturbation wave-lengths of 260-265 km are found to
   be the most unstable, with e-folding growth periods of 7-11
   days and along-jet phase speeds of 4-8 km/d downstream.  Energy
   transformation terms and energy budgets are discussed.  Both
   barotropic and baroclinic instability processes are important.
