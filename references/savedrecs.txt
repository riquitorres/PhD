TI Seasonal climatology of hydrographic conditions in the
   upwelling region off northern Chile
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Over 30 years of hydrographic data from the northern Chile (18
   degreesS-24 degreesS) upwelling region are used to calculate
   the surface and subsurface seasonal climatology extending 400
   km offshore. The data are interpolated to a grid with
   sufficient spatial resolution to preserve cross-shelf gradients
   and then presented as means within four seasons: austral winter
   (July-September), spring (October-December), summer (January-
   March), and fall (April-June). Climatological monthly wind
   forcing, surface temperature, and sea level from three coastal
   stations indicate equatorward (upwelling favorable) winds
   throughout the year, weakest in the north. Seasonal maximum
   alongshore wind stress is in late spring and summer (December-
   March). Major water masses of the region are identified in
   climatological T-S plots and their sources and implied
   circulation discussed. Surface fields and vertical transects of
   temperature and salinity confirm that upwelling occurs year-
   round, strongest in summer and weakest in winter, bringing
   relatively fresh water to the surface nearshore. Surface
   geostrophic flow nearshore is equatorward throughout the year.
   During summer, an anticyclonic circulation feature in the north
   which extends to at least 200 m depth is evident in
   geopotential anomaly and in both temperature and geopotential
   variance fields. Subsurface fields indicate generally poleward
   flow throughout the year, strongest in an undercurrent near the
   coast. This undercurrent is strongest in summer and most
   persistent and organized in the south (south of 21 degreesS), A
   subsurface oxygen minimum, centered at similar to 250 m, is
   strongest at lower latitudes. Low-salinity subsurface water
   intrudes into the study area near 100 m, predominantly in
   offshore regions, strongest during summer and fall and in the
   southernmost portion of the region. The climatological fields
   are compared to features off Baja within the somewhat analogous
   California Current and to measurements from higher latitudes
   within the Chile-Peru Current system.

TI The California Current system in the Southern California Bight
   and the Santa Barbara channel
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Recent observations in the Santa Barbara Channel and over the
   California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations
   (CalCOFI) southern California grid are used to examine seasonal
   circulation patterns in and near the Southern California Eight,
   defined as the region east of the Santa Rosa Ridge and
   including the Santa Barbara Channel. Poleward flow relative to
   500 m is found throughout the bight, in all seasons except for
   spring and all subregions except the western part of the Santa
   Barbara Channel. In spring there is equatorward flow throughout
   the bight at all depths to 500 m, though it tends to be surface
   or midcolumn intensified. Equatorward flow offshore of the
   bight, present in all seasons, narrows and accelerates into a
   jet-like feature and simultaneously moves close to the Santa
   Rosa Ridge in summer. Current meter data from the eastern
   entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel are consistent with the
   seasonal results from the CalCOFI data and further show an
   upward propagation of phase at annual period, with a phase
   speed of 1 to 2 m d(-1). Comparison with the CalCOFI ship winds
   suggests that poleward flow in the bight may be the result of
   positive wind stress curl, through a Sverdrup balance, though
   the observed transport is only about 75% of that expected from
   the curl amplitude. Equatorward flow in the bight may be the
   result of coastal upwelling, though the transport is larger
   than expected from the relatively weak winds in the bight, and
   the offshore extent of the equatorward flow is about 10 Rossby
   radii, farther than might be expected for linearized coastal
   upwelling. Equatorward flow outside the bight cannot be
   explained as a Sverdrup flow because the wind stress curl is
   positive throughout mast of the region. Upward propagation of
   phase and downward propagation of energy may be indicative of
   forcing by remote wind equatorward of the bight. Given the
   complexity of possible forcing mechanisms for circulation in
   and near the bight, a model that includes effects of remote
   wind forcing, Ekman pumping, and topography is needed to
   explain the observations in a satisfactory way.

TI Data assimilation model study of wind effects in the Santa
   Barbara Channel
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Seasonal mean circulation in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC)
   consists of poleward flow on the northern shelf and equatorward
   flow on the southern shelf. While the equatorward flow is in
   the direction of the persistent, upwelling-favorable wind, the
   inshore poleward flow is against the wind. The channel
   circulation also has a strong seasonal signal that the cyclonic
   circulation strengthens considerably in spring and summer. A
   three-dimensional model is used to simulate the observed
   currents over an 8-month period from January to August 1994.
   The model assimilates the moored temperature and salinity data
   obtained from a comprehensive circulation study in the SEC-
   Santa Maria Basin (SME). The model also incorporates surface
   wind forcing; the mesoscale wind stress pattern is derived from
   a dense network of weather buoys. The model simulation
   reproduces well the surface mean currents and their seasonal
   (monthly) variability. The transient (less than seasonal) model
   velocity response consists of two fundamental modes, a wind-
   forced mode and an alongshore pressure gradient-forced mode.
   The wind-driven circulation is concentrated west of the channel
   in the SMB. The alongshore pressure gradient-forced motion is
   concentrated in the channel along the northern coast. Analysis
   of the evolution of inshore poleward current suggests that the
   spring transition in this region may coincide with the end of
   the winter storm season.

TI Spatial and temporal characteristics of the mesoscale
   circulation of the California Current from eddy-resolving
   moored and shipboard measurements
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Moored observations of currents and temperatures made in the
   upper 600 m on eddy-resolving scales over a 2-year period are
   used to examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of the
   California Current mesoscale circulation. The observations were
   made at three principal longitudes: 124 degrees W, 126 degrees
   W, and 128 degrees W in the vicinity of Point Arena. They
   bracket the 600-km-wide band of high mesoscale variability
   found along the eastern boundary of the North Pacific. At all
   locations, the mesoscale variability was larger than the mean
   flow, and the spatial modes of variability as determined from
   empirical orthogonal function analysis consisted of an
   alongshore mode, a cross-shore mode, and a rotational mode.
   Observations made near the continental slope (124 degrees W)
   were dominated by the poleward flowing California Undercurrent,
   with mesoscale eddies and meanders superposed. The nearshore
   eddy kinetic energy peaked in a band centered around 60 days.
   Observations made at 128 degrees W, near the offshore boundary
   between the energetic mesoscale band and the "eddy desert" of
   the northeast Pacific, were characterized by small means, fewer
   eddy events, and a peak in eddy kinetic energy at 120-180 days.
   The good horizontal resolution of the current meter arrays
   allowed us to estimate the relative vorticity, horizontal
   divergence, and Rossby number and therefore to evaluate the
   relative strength and occurrence of anticyclones and cyclones.
   We found the mesoscale eddy field to be strongly nonlinear,
   with Rossby numbers ranging from 0.1 to 0.5. All of the eddies
   observed at the offshore site were nonlinear, deep, warm
   anticyclones. Shipboard hydrography revealed the origin of one
   of these anticyclones to be the California Undercurrent, and
   this eddy retained its strong anomalies after several months
   and several hundred kilometers of propagation. Despite the
   lower incidence of eddies as one moves west from the coast, the
   eddies that we observed offshore provide evidence for
   propagation and transport of properties from the coast to the
   central North Pacific across the California Current System.

TI Stratified flow over topography: time-dependent comparisons
   between model solutions and observations
SO DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
AB Detailed observations of stratified flow over a sill in Knight
   Inlet, British Columbia are compared with numerical solutions
   from a two-dimensional primitive equation model. The comparison
   focuses on the establishment of the high drag state over the
   sill in response to a time-varying barotropic forcing
   associated with an ebbing tidal flow. The results show that the
   model solution evolves to a hydraulically controlled, high drag
   state that is similar to the observed one. However, the model
   evolution to this state occurs rapidly through an overturning
   internal wave response with subsequent convective mixing. On
   the other hand, the observations show a more gradual evolution
   with no apparent overturning. It is suggested that flow
   separation in the lee of the sill crest, which typically is not
   well represented in models of stratified flow, likely exerts a
   strong control on the rate and manner in which the high drag
   state becomes established. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

TI Lagrangian exploration of the California undercurrent, 1992-85
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB During the period 1992-95, nineteen isobaric RAFOS floats,
   placed in the California Undercurrent at intermediate depths
   (150-600 m) off Monterey and San Francisco, California, reveal
   a region of varying width of subsurface, poleward flow adjacent
   to the continental margin. The float trajectories exhibit three
   patterns: poleward how in the undercurrent; reversing, but
   predominately alongshore, flow adjacent to the continental
   margin; and; farther offshore, anticyclonic motion accompanied
   by slow westward drift. Flow continuity of the undercurrent
   exists between Pt. Reyes and at least Cape Mendocino with an
   average speed dependent on the float depth. Speeds were
   variable, bur common features were acceleration occurring to
   the south of Pt. Arena and deceleration to the north of Cape
   Mendocino. An important mechanism for floats, and water, to
   enter the ocean interior from the undercurrent is through the
   formation of submesoscale coherent vortices.

TI Test of turbulence models for wind flow over terrain with

AB Several two-equation turbulence models using isotropic eddy
   viscosity and wall functions are assessed by solution of the
   neutral atmospheric boundary layer over a flat surface and wind
   flow over two- and three-dimensional models and real terrain.
   Calculations are presented for wind flow over the Sirhowy
   Valley in Wales, an embankment along the Rhine in Germany and
   the Askervein Hill in Scotland. Comparisons of predictions with
   previous work, and laboratory and field data, show that the
   RNG-based k-epsilon model gives the best agreement with respect
   to the flow profiles and length of the separated flow region.
   The results of this model are analyzed with a non-linear

TI The impact of air-flow separation on the drag of the sea
   surface
SO BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY
AB An approach that allows assessment of the impact of air-flow
   separation (AFS) from wave breaking fronts on the sea-surface
   drag is presented. Wave breaking fronts are modelled by the
   discontinuities of the sea-surface slope. It is assumed that
   the dynamics of the AFS from wave breaking crests is similar to
   that from the backward facing step. The form drag supported by
   an individual breaker is described by the action of the
   pressure drop distributed along the forward face of the
   breaking front. The total stress due to the AFS is obtained as
   a sum of contributions from breaking fronts of different
   scales. Outside the breaking fronts the drag of the sea surface
   is supported by the viscous surface stress and the wave-induced
   stress. To calculate the stress due to the AFS and the wave-
   induced stress a physical model of the wind-wave spectrum is
   used. Together with the model of the air flow described in
   terms of surface stresses it forms a self-consistent dynamical
   system for the sea surface-atmosphere where the air flow and
   wind waves are strongly coupled. Model calculations of the drag
   coefficient agree with measurements. It is shown that the
   dimensionless Charnock parameter (roughness length normalized
   on the square of the friction velocity and the acceleration of
   gravity) increases with the increase of the wind speed in
   agreement with field measurements. The stress due to the AFS
   normalized on the square of the friction velocity is
   proportional to the cube of wind speed. At low winds the
   viscous surface stress dominates the drag. The role of the form
   drag, which is the sum of the stress due to the AFS and the
   wave-induced stress, is negligible. At moderate and high winds
   the form drag dominates. At wind speeds higher than 10 m s(-1)
   the stress supported by the AFS becomes comparable to the wave-
   induced stress and supports up to 50% of the total stress.

   of the East Madagascar Current is described. The upwelling cell
   has cold surface water, with high concentrations of
   chlorophyll-a. It is located where this current moves from a
   bathymetry characterised by a narrow continental shelf and a
   steep slope to one characterised by a wider shelf and a less
   steep slope. There seems to be no correlation between the local

TI Subtidal currents over the central California slope: evidence
   for offshore veering of the undercurrent and for direct, wind-
   driven slope currents
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB In February 1991, an array of six current meter moorings was
   deployed for one year across the central California outer shelf
   and slope. The main line of the array extended 30 km offshore
   of the shelf break, out to water depths of 1400 m. A more
   sparsely-instrumented line, displaced 30 km to the northwest,
   extended 14 km offshore. Though shorter, the northern line
   spanned similar water depths because the gradient of the
   topography steepened in the northern region. A poleward flow
   pattern, typical of the California undercurrent, was seen
   across both lines in the array over most of the year. The
   poleward flow was surface intensified. In general, the portion
   of the undercurrent that crossed the southern line had larger
   amplitudes and penetrated more deeply into the water column
   than the portion that crossed the northern line. Transport over
   the year ranged from 0 to 2.5 Sverdrups (Sv) poleward across
   the southern line; 0 to 1 Sv poleward across the northern line.
   We suggest the difference in transport was caused by
   topographic constraints, which tended to force the poleward
   flow offshore of the northern measurement sites. The slope of
   the topography steepened too abruptly to allow the poleward
   flow to follow isobaths when currents were strong. When current
   velocities lessened, a more coherent flow pattern was seen
   across both lines in the array. In general, the poleward flow
   patterns in the undercurrent were not affected by local winds
   or by the local alongshore pressure gradient. Nor was a strong
   seasonal pattern evident. Rather unexpectedly, a small but
   statistically significant fraction of the current variance over
   the mid- and outer slope was driven by the surface wind stress.
   An alongshelf wind stress caused cut-rents to flow along the
   slope, parallel to the wind field, down to depths of 400 m
   below the surface and out to distances of 2 Rossby radii past
   the shelf break. The transfer functions were weak, 3-4 cm/s per
   dyn cm(-2) but comparable to wind-driven current amplitudes of
   4-6 cm/s per unit wind stress over the middle shelf.
   Equatorward, alongshelf winds also caused water from 200-300 m
   over the slope to upwell onto the shelf as the surface water
   moved offshore. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

TI A forcing mechanism for the poleward flow off the southern
   California coast
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB It is shown that when the wind distribution along a coast is
   anisotropic, such that its cross-shore scale is smaller than
   its alongshore scale, the coastal sea level (or the upper layer
   anamoly) "A" of an ocean forced by both wind and wind curl is
   governed by a modified (nondimensionalized) Kelvin wave
   equation: partial derivative A/partial derivative t* + partial
   derivative A/partial derivative y* = k(0)(0, y*, t*) + integral
   partial derivative k(1)/partial derivative y* dt(L) where k(0)
   and k(1) are wind stress and wind stress curl at the coast,
   respectively, y is the alongshore distance, and t is the time.
   Numerical experiments, from a simple reduced-gravity type with
   idealized forcing and coastline to a three-dimensional
   primitive equation model with a realistic coastline, bottom
   topography of the Southern California Eight and the Santa
   Barbara Channel, and observed wind stresses, were carried out
   to show that the observed near-coast near-surface poleward flow
   in the region is primarily forced by the equatorward weakening
   of the wind curl, (partial derivative k(1)/partial derivative
   y* >0), in the bight. Beta provides natural damping by
   weakening and widening the current through westward propagating
   Rossby waves and causes the current to lead the coastal
   pressure field by 1-2 months, which improves the agreement with
   observations of the phasing of the modeled currents but is
   otherwise not required in forcing the poleward flow.

TI Seasonal and interannual variability of currents and
   temperature off central Chile
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Results are reported for continuous, 6 year records of current
   and temperature from a continental slope station at 30 degrees
   S off Chile. These observations for November 1991 to November
   1997 span the moderate, weak, and strong El Nino events of
   1991-1992, 1994, and 1997 and the La Nina event of 1995-1996.
   Results for current and temperature are analyzed together with
   observations of wind along the South American coast from the
   ERS-1 and -2 satellite scatterometers, wind from a local
   coastal site, sea level from northern and central Chile, sea
   surface temperature anomalies from the South Pacific region,
   and traditional El Nino indices. Mean poleward flow of 12.8 cm
   s(-1) was observed for the 6 year period in the core of the
   Peru-Chile Undercurrent (220 m). Mean flow in the depth range
   of Antarctic Intermediate Water (750 m) was equatorward at 1.1
   cm s(-1). Intraseasonal-scale variability associated with
   coastal trapped waves was weaker during the austral winter:
   greatest during El Nino events and weakest during the La Nina
   event. Winds adjacent to the coast showed a strong annual cycle
   with a southward progression of maximum equatorward (upwelling
   favorable) winds. Alongshore flow over the slope exhibited
   strong semiannual and weaker annual variations. Poleward flow
   in the undercurrent was strongest in the austral spring and
   fall and weakest in the winter. Near the bottom (750 m),
   seasonal-scale variability was less intense but led that higher
   up in the water column (220 m) by similar to 1 month. Strong
   interannual variability of alongshore current and temperature
   was found at all depths over the slope, whereby changes at
   depth led changes higher up. A rapid warming event was observed
   at the end of 1996-beginning of 1997 over the slope. This
   event, also seen in sea level and sea surface temperature off
   Chile, led El Nino indices by several months and may be best
   explained by local wind anomalies coupled to atmospheric
   teleconnections from the western tropical Pacific at the onset
   of El Nino. Some aspects of our current and temperature
   observations are consistent with results from eastern boundary
   current models. Our results indicate that both ocean and
   atmosphere pathways from the equatorial Pacific contribute
   significantly to interannual-scale variability of alongshore
   flow and thermocline depth off Chile.

TI Comparisons between a fine resolution model and observations in
   the Iberian shelf-slope region
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB Results from a fine resolution model of the Iberian shelf-slope
   region are compared with data from cruises conducted in the
   same area. The agreement between the model and a cruise carried
   out in May 1993 is qualitatively good. The model is also able
   to represent the seasonal cycle in the area as revealed by
   cruises carried out in November 1993 and July/August 1994.
   Quantitative agreement between the model and the observations
   is less good and this is a result of limitations in the data
   used to force the model at the surface and the boundaries.
   Features of the circulation which are modeled well include
   seasonal coastal upwelling, the winter Portugal Coastal
   Countercurrent and the spreading of Mediterranean Water.
   Coastal upwelling occurs in summer and is enhanced off Cape
   Finisterre: and Cape Roca. The Portugal Coastal Countercurrent
   exists in the model as a poleward flow over the upper
   continental slops which is strongest in winter but persists
   throughout the year and in summer is seen as a weak sub-surface
   feature. Mediterranean Water spreads northwards in two cores
   with a distinct focussing towards the coast to the north of the
   Tagus Plateau. The particular form of open boundary conditions
   employed perform well with little evidence of false reflection
   of outgoing waves. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   compared to the residence time in the channel (about 7 days) is
   also included. In the channel the trajectories document a
   persistent cyclonic circulation with a typical recirculation
   period between 3 and 5 days. In the spring, currents near the
   mainland are weaker than near the Channel Islands, and the
   overall flow is toward the southeast. Trajectories document the
   possibility for water parcels to leave the channel through the
   interisland passes. In the late fall and winter a poleward flow
   with velocities often exceeding 0.5 m s(-1) is confined within
   20 km of the mainland. Between these two seasons the cyclonic
   tendency is enhanced, although most of the drifters eventually
   migrate westward. The trajectories of drifters released at the
   same time from sites only 20 km apart can be remarkably
   different. Once the drifters migrate out of the channel, their
   trajectories can be grouped into a few patterns. In spring and
   summer, drifters tend to remain in the Southern California
   Eight. Their trajectories often remain close over extended
   periods, as if they were caught in convergence zones. In fall
   the drifters often are caught in a poleward current.

TI A vorticity dynamics theory of three-dimensional flow
   separation
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB A theory of three-dimensional incompressible flow separation is
   presented in terms of the on-wall signatures of the flow. Some
   long-standing controversial issues are revisited and answers
   given, such as the inconsistency of the separation criteria
   based on the topological theory and "open separation," and
   whether a separation line is an asymptote or envelope of
   neighboring skin-friction lines. General criteria for
   identifying an "open" or "closed" flow separation zone and
   separation line (including the initial point of the latter),
   steady and unsteady, are obtained, which apply to a generic
   smooth curved wall at any Reynolds numbers. The criteria are
   found to be most clearly given in terms of on-wall signatures
   of vorticity dynamics. These are then specified to steady
   boundary layer separation at large Reynolds numbers. A scale
   analysis under mild assumptions leads to a three-dimensional
   triple-deck structure near a generic boundary layer separation
   line. Criteria are presented for "separation watch," which
   tells that a boundary-layer may soon break away, and for
   "separation warning," which identifies the vorticity
   characteristics in an already formed boundary-layer separation
   zone and along a boundary-layer separation line. Flow behavior
   and its dependence on outer flow conditions are examined
   qualitatively. A numerical example is given which confirms the
   predictions of the theory. (C) 2000 American Institute of
