	  As the El Nino-generated warm coastal current passes the Mendocino

	  enhanced. In contrast, for a cord coastal current, the amplitude
	  will be reduced north of the Mendocino escarpment. When the Kelvin

	  predicted to be much larger than over a depth decrease (as in the
	  case of the Mendocino escarpment). This model is also applicable to
	  bottom water flowing equatorward along a western boundary. In this
	  case, much larger amplitude changes are found.

	  density stratification caused by weaker tidal mixing over regions
	  of greater bottom depth. Additional spatial differences in seasonal
	  SST variability and noted in covariance EOF mode 3 are related to
	  regional differences in seasonal thermohaline and density
	  characteristics of surface waters across the Gulf of Maine.
	  Regional surface water differences across the Gulf of Maine are
	  caused by different phasing between annual cycles of vertical heat
	  flux and inputs of low-salinity Scotian Shelf water in eastern Gulf
	  of Maine during late winter and local freshwater runoff from rivers
	  in western Gulf of Maine during late spring. Covariance EOF mode 2
	  represents 3.0\% of observed SST variance and describes interannual
	  SST variability manifested by a cooling trend within the slope
	  water region caused by a decrease in Gulf Stream warm-core ring
	  activity during the study period. The gradient EOF analysis shows
	  results that support and supplement the covariance EOF analysis by
	  depicting the year-round nature of the SST gradient associated with
	  the shelf break front (mode 1, 86.4\% of SST variance) and SST
	  gradients arising from spatial variation in the seasonal heating

	  the Santa Barbara Channel. Poleward flow relative to 500 m is found

	  Equatorward flow outside the bight cannot be explained as a
	  Sverdrup flow because the wind stress curl is positive throughout
	  mast of the region. Upward propagation of phase and downward
	  propagation of energy may be indicative of forcing by remote wind
	  equatorward of the bight. Given the complexity of possible forcing
	  mechanisms for circulation in and near the bight, a model that

	  topography is needed to explain the observations in a satisfactory

	  hydraulic transition of a potential-vorticity-conserving coastal
	  current as it passes a topographic anomaly at which it is exactly
	  critical to long coastal-trapped waves. An analytic 1.5-layer model
	  of coastal hydraulics with constant potential vorticity in each
	  layer predicts flow fields (i.e., jet separation) in critical
	  situations that resemble observations. When scales approximate Cape
	  Blanco on the Oregon coast, separation occurs at a jet transport of
	  around 0.76 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1), similar to observed transports.
	  Time-dependent, semigeostrophic calculations suggest that, during
	  an upwelling season, the jet would evolve from a weak flow, which
	  was subcritical everywhere and symmetric about the cape, to an
	  exactly critical state that made a transition from subcritical to
	  supercritical structure at the head of the cape. The predicted flow
	  field at critical transition consists of a narrow upwelling jet
	  upstream of the cape that moves offshore and broadens at the cape.
	  This critical state would be accompanied by a downstream jump back
	  to subcritical conditions. Further upwelling-favorable winds would
	  lead to transient waves that propagated upstream and downstream,
	  modifying the upstream and downstream conditions and restoring
	  criticality. Thus, the head of the cape exerts hydraulic control on
	  the flow and prevents the jet transport from increasing above its
	  critical level. Inherent in the hydraulic approach is the
	  assumption that alongshore scales are large. For realistic
	  alongshore scales, solutions modified by coastline curvature
	  suggest that the convexity of the head of a cape slightly inhibits
	  the transition to a strongly upwelled downstream state by
	  increasing the required critical transport. In the presence of
	  topographic features with finite alongshore scale, the hydraulic
	  approach can be used to construct a flow field, although this flow
	  field has an inherent error arising from the implicit assumptions
	  regarding scales. Estimation of this error for topography
	  representing Cape Blanco suggests that in places the cape is rather
	  abrupt for hydraulic theory to be valid.

             spring and autumn of 1984 are used to characterize the seasonal
             and subtidal variability in the source region of the Delaware
             coastal current. There are several major features of the coastal
             current which are common between dhe two seasons. At the mooring
             site the structure of the mean current indicates estuarine
             outflow from surface-to-bottom. The magnitude of the mean flow
             decreases and the direction of the mean flow veers further
             downshelf to the south and SSW with increasing depth. The water
             column is nor vertically well-mixed, and a surfaceto-bottom
             salinity difference of about 2 exists for both seasons. Local
             wind does nor appear to be the dominant factor responsible for
             producing the subtidal current fluctuations, especially at very
             low frequencies (<0.1 cycles day(-1)). The current vectors are
             only coherent with the clockwise rotating part of the wind
             vector. In addition to these major features which occur in both
             seasons, there are major differences as well. The magnitude of
             the mean flow decreases by a factor of two and the mean salinity
             increases by about 2 from spring to autumn, probably in response
             to the seasonal cycle in the Delaware River discharge. During
             autumn, the subtidal currents show coherent fluctuations
             throughout the water column, and these currents are essentially
             rectilinear and aligned in the same direction. During spring, the
             current variance along the semiminor axis is more significant and
             there is an appreciable difference in the principal axis
             direction between the surface and the bottom. In spring, the
             current and salinity show coherent fluctuations at frequencies
             lower than 0.1 cycles day(-1). These low frequency fluctuations
             are apparently caused by earlier river discharge events. The lag
             between the major river discharge events and the very
             low-frequency variations in salinity is about 3 weeks. In autumn,
             the current and salinity are significantly coherent at subtidal
             frequencies higher than 0.2 cycles day(-1). The intratidal
             salinity variability is substantially larger in spring than in
             autumn. The strength of the buoyant outflow in spring produces an
             enhanced horizontal salinity gradient, which in turn results in
             an increase in the intratidal salinity variability relative to
             that in autumn. This result suggests that the tidal variability
             in salinity can be strongly influenced by the non-linear
             interactions with the subtidal variability in the Delaware
             coastal current. (C) 1998 Academic Press.}

	  calculations show that the spread of the plume and its vertical
	  mixing are very sensitive to the values of vertical viscosity and
	  diffusivity. These coefficients are initially determined with a
	  two-equation turbulence energy model, although subsequent
	  calculations show that similar results can be obtained using a one
	  equation model provided suitable stability functions are chosen for
	  viscosity and diffusivity. Calculations assuming a constant water
	  depth show that the offshore spread of the plume is greatest from
	  an along shore upwelling favourable wind which gives rise to an
	  offshore spread as a surface buoyant jet. An along shore
	  downwelling favourable wind slightly reduces the offshore spread.
	  In the case of a sloping bottom the offshore extent is reduced by
	  the bottom slope, with the surface wind driven flow being a maximum
	  in the near shore region. The magnitude of the surface current is
	  sensitive to assumed values of the surface roughness length, and in
	  the region of the plume shows a significant spatial variability due
	  to a combination of a surface wind driven flow and that produced by
	  the plume outflow. Suggestions as to how a proposed experiment
	  involving a shore based HF Radar and a salinity survey in the
	  region of the Ebro plume may be used to validate a physically
	  realistic model of the region are made. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

	  forced at the open boundary with model results from the East Coast
	  Forecast System. The first experiment is forced by monthly
	  climatological wind and heat flux from the Comprehensive Ocean
	  Atmosphere Data Set; discharges from the Saint John, Penobscot,
	  Kennebec, and Merrimack Rivers are added in the second experiment;
	  the semidiurnal lunar tide (M-2) is included as part of the open
	  boundary forcing in the third experiment. It is found that the
	  surface heat flux plays an important role in regulating the annual
	  cycle of the circulation in the Gulf of Maine. The spinup of the
	  cyclonic circulation between April and June is likely caused by the
	  differential heating between the interior gulf and the exterior
	  shelf/slope region. From June to December the cyclonic circulation
	  continues to strengthen, but gradually shrinks in size. When winter
	  cooling erodes the stratification, the cyclonic circulation
	  penetrates deeper into the water column. The circulation quickly
	  spins down from December to February as most of the energy is
	  consumed by bottom friction. While inclusion of river discharge
	  changes details of the circulation pattern, the annual evolution of
	  the circulation is largely unaffected. On the other hand, inclusion
	  of the tide results in not only the anticyclonic circulation on
	  Georges Bank but also modifications to the seasonal circulation.

	  profiler surveys conducted in August 1996 on the New Jersey inner
	  shelf revealed a buoyant intrusion advancing southward along the
	  coast. This buoyant intrusion originated from the Hudson estuary
	  more than 100 km upshelf and appeared as a bulge of less saline
	  water with a sharp across-shelf frontal zone at ifs leading edge.
	  During this time, the study area was also forced by a brief
	  upwelling-favorable wind event opposing the direction of buoyant
	  flow propagation. The interaction of buoyancy and wind forcing
	  generated a spatially variable velocity field. In particular,
	  across-shelf currents were comparable to their alongshelf
	  counterparts. Variability in the alongshelf direction occurred on
	  the scales of the order of the baroclinic Rossby radius. intensive
	  across-shelf currents reached speeds of 20-40 cm s(-1) and appeared
	  as spatially localized mesoscale flows with a width of O(10 km).
	  They were generated at the leading edge of the buoyant intrusion
	  and persisted over the period of observations, slowly propagating
	  southward along with the buoyant flow. They were essentially
	  baroclinic with strong vertical sheer and were further amplified by
	  the wind forcing. The upwelling-favorable wind event also generated
	  cyclonic circulation within the buoyant intrusion, which has not
	  been observed before. Interaction of the opposing wind and buoyancy
	  forcings deformed the pycnocline into a dome. This dome was
	  effectively isolated from windinduced turbulent mixing by
	  overlying buoyant water, The adjustment of the velocity field to
	  this density disturbance occurred geostrophically, even though the
	  water depth was only 20-30 m and friction was important. Relative
	  vorticity associated with this cyclonic flow was at least 0.3f.}
