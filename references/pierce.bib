@ARTICLE{BarthBPK98,
	author	    = {Barth, J. A. and Bogucki, D. and Pierce, S. D. and
	  Kosro, P. M.},
	title	    = {Secondary circulation associated with a shelfbreak
	  front},
	journal     = {Geophys. Res. Lett.},
	year	    = {1998},
	volume	    = {25},
	pages	    = {2761-2764},
	abstract    = {Evidence for secondary circulation associated with a
	  shelfbreak front is obtained from a high-resolution, cross-shelf
	  section of hydrographic, optical and velocity fields. Convergence
	  in the bottom boundary layer on the inshore side of the front and
	  subsequent upwelling into the interior is evident by a midwater
	  region of suspended bottom material emanating from the foot of the
	  front and extending to within 35 m of the surface, 80 m above
	  bottom. Downwelling on the offshore side of the front in the upper
	  water column is inferred from a 20-m downward bend of the
	  subsurface phytoplankton layer. These observations are in agreement
	  with recent model predictions for secondary circulation near an
	  idealized shelfbreak front. Convergence in measured cross-shelf
	  velocity at the foot of the front is consistent with upwelling of
	  bottom material detected there. An estimate of 9+/-2 m day(-1) of
	  upwelling on the inshore side of the shelfbreak front is obtained,
	  implying a transit time from the bottom to the surface of 10-16
	  days.}

	abstract    = {Several recent data sets improve our view of the
	  poleward undercurrent of the California Current System. As part of
	  a triennial National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) survey of
	  Pacific whiting, a series of 105 shipboard acoustic Doppler current
	  profiler (ADCP) velocity sections across the shelf break from 33 to
	  51 degrees N at about 18 km meridional spacing were collected from
	  July to August 1995. Significant (> 0.05 ms(-1)) subsurface
	  poleward flow occurred in 91\% of the sections. A mean cross-shelf
	  section using the entire data set has statistical significance,
	  revealing an undercurrent core > 0.1 ms(-1) from 200-275 m depth
	  20-25 km off the shelf break. The mean poleward volume transport in
	  a 125-325 m layer is 0.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1). We focus
	  particular attention on the Cape Blanco to Cape Mendocino region,
	  and the NMFS results are compared with shipboard ADCP three weeks
	  later from a study of coastal upwelling processes near Cape Blanco.
	  ADCP streamfunction maps are derived and strongly suggest that one
	  portion of flow is continuous over the 440 km meridional extent of
	  the analysis region. Other portions of the flow show evidence of
	  offshore turning, separation, and the formation of anti-cyclonic
	  eddies. We also note that isopycnic potential vorticity from
	  alongslope CTD stations during the NMFS survey appears to be a
	  tracer for the poleward how. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

	  with widearea differential GPS and adaptive smoothing of ship
	  velocity},
	journal     = {J. Atmos. Ocean. Technol.},
	year	    = {1999},
	volume	    = {16},
	pages	    = {591-596},
	abstract    = {Accurate ship velocity is important for determining
	  absolute currents from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP)
	  measurements. In this paper, the authors describe the application
	  of two methods to improve the quality of ship velocity estimates.
	  The first uses wide-area differential global positioning system
	  (WADGPS) navigation to improve ship positioning. During the cruise,
	  raw global positioning system (GPS) pseudorange data are collected.
	  The pseudorange measurement is the difference between satellite
	  transmission time and receiver reception time of a GPS signal. A
	  few days after the cruise, satellite clock corrections from the
	  Canadian Active Control System and orbital parameters from the U.S.
	  Coast Guard Navigation Center are used to derive WADGPS positions
	  that remove the position degradation effects of selective
	  availability. Two-dimensional root-mean-square (rms) position
	  accuracies reduce from +/-34 to +/-9 m. The authors' second method
	  of improving the ship velocity applies an adaptive local
	  third-order polynomial smoother to the raw ship velocities. This
	  smoothing method is particularly effective at handling the
	  nonstationary nature of the signal when the ship is starting,
	  stopping, or turning, which is typical of oceanographic cruises.
	  Application of the smoother in this case reduces overall rms noise
	  in the ship velocity by 16\%. The combination of both methods
	  reduces the uncertainty due to navigation of a 20-min ADCP absolute
	  velocity from +/-0.063 to +/-0.038 m s(-1)-a 40\% reduction. These
	  methods also improve the calibration for sensitivity error and
	  ADCP-gyrocompass misalignment angle.
