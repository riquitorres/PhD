TI Downwelling circulation on the Oregon continental shelf .1.
   Response to idealized forcing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Time-dependent downwelling on the Oregon continental shelf is
   studied with a two-dimensional approximation, that is, spatial
   variations across shelf and with depth, using the Blumberg-
   Mellor, finite-difference, stratified, hydrostatic, primitive
   equation model. The time-dependent response of a coastal ocean
   at rest to constant, downwelling-favorable wind stress is
   examined. Topography and stratification representative of the
   Oregon continental shelf are used for the basic case
   experiment. The wind stress forces onshore Row in a turbulent
   surface boundary layer. The compensating Row below the surface
   layer advects the density field downward and offshore and
   accelerates an alongshore current in the form of a vertically
   and horizontally sheared coastal jet. The dominant feature of
   the response Row field is a downwelling front that moves slowly
   offshore, leaving behind an inshore region where the density is
   well mixed. The downwelling front in the density field is
   concentrated near the bottom, while the front in alongshore
   velocity extends over the full depth and is nearly vertical,
   separating weak alongshore velocities inshore from the coastal
   jet offshore. The front contains strong vertical motion from
   the surface to the bottom and some recirculation. Much of the
   offshore flow from the base of the front is characterized by
   time- and space-dependent fluctuations involving spatially
   periodic separation and reattachment of the bottom boundary
   layer and accompanying recirculation cells. This Row has
   positive potential vorticity and appears to be finite-amplitude
   slantwise convection resulting from a hydrostatic symmetric
   instability. Additional experiments show the dependence of the
   response flow field on the magnitude of the wind stress, the
   initial stratification, and the shelf topography. Experiments
   with the vertical turbulent kinematic viscosity and diffusivity
   parameterized by a different turbulence closure scheme, as a
   function of a local Richardson number, or as constants show
   dependence of the response flow field on the choice of
   turbulence submodel. The occurrence of a well-mixed region
   inshore and the existence of time- and space-dependent
   fluctuations associated with slantwise convection in the near-
   bottom offshore flow appear to be robust features of the two-
   dimensional downwelling response.

TI UPWELLING CIRCULATION ON THE OREGON CONTINENTAL-SHELF .1.
   RESPONSE TO IDEALIZED FORCING
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Time-dependent upwelling on the Oregon continental shelf is
   studied with a two-dimensional approximation, that is, spatial
   variations across-shelf and with depth, using the Blumberg-
   Mellor, finite-difference, stratified, primitive equation
   model. The time-dependent response of a coastal ocean at rest
   to constant, upwelling favorable, wind stress is examined.
   Topography and stratification representative of the Oregon
   continental shelf are used for the basic case experiment. The
   wind stress forces offshore flow in a turbulent surface
   boundary layer. The compensating onshore flow below the surface
   layer accelerates an alongshore current in the form of a
   vertically and horizontally sheared coastal jet. Dense water is
   advected onshore and upward into the surface layer. An
   upwelling front characterized by relatively large horizontal
   gradients in density and alongshore velocity v is formed near
   the surface at the inshore edge of the coastal jet. Large
   vertical gradients in v and large values of turbulent kinetic
   energy are also found in the frontal region. Additional
   experiments show the dependence of the response flow field on
   the initial stratification and the shelf topography.
   Experiments with the vertical turbulent kinematic viscosity and
   diffusivity parameterized as constants or as functions of a
   local Richardson number show substantial dependence of the
   response flow field on the choice of turbulence submodel.

TI Diagnosis of vertical velocities with the QG omega equation: an
   examination of the errors due to sampling strategy
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB Vertical motion at the mesoscale plays a key role in ocean
   circulation, ocean-atmosphere interaction, and hence climate.
   It is not yet possible to make direct Eulerian measurements of
   vertical velocities less than 1000 m day(-1). However, by
   assuming quasi-geostrophic (QG) balance, vertical velocities O
   (10 m day(-1)) can be diagnosed from the geostrophic velocity
   field and suitable boundary conditions. Significant errors in
   the accuracy of this diagnosis arise from the necessary
   compromise between spatial resolution and synopticity of a
   hydrographic survey. This problem has been addressed by
   sampling the output of a numerical ocean model to simulate
   typical oceanographic surveys of mesoscale fronts. The balance
   between the number of observations and the synopticity of
   observations affects the apparent flow and in particular the
   diagnosed vertical motion. A combination of effects can
   typically lead to errors of 85% in the estimation of net
   vertical heat flux. An analytical two-layer model is used to
   understand components of this error and indicate the key
   parameters for the design of mesoscale sampling. (C) 2000

TI Satellite derived sea surface temperature variability off
   California during the upwelling season
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB An empirical orthogonal function analysis of an advanced very
   high resolution radiometer sea surface temperature data set
   encompassing the spring-summer period during 1991-1993 was used
   to examine patterns of temperature variability off northern and
   central California. This analysis decomposed the spatial
   variability of remotely sensed sea surface temperature in 124
   images that covered an offshore distance of 200 km and an
   alongshore distance of 500 km. The first mode empirical
   orthogonal function described 65% of the spatial variability in
   the data set. The spatial amplitude patter of the first mode,
   which closely resembled the mean of all the images, revealed a
   strong cross-shore gradient with much cooler water nearshore
   and warmer water offshore. These areas of cool waters were
   associated with known upwelling locales, and the large-scale
   temperature structure compared favorably to that derived from
   historical California Cooperative Oceanographic Fisheries
   Investigation (CalCOFI) climatology. The mode 1 temporal
   amplitude function, representing the temporal modulation of
   this spatial patter, was coupled with changes in the alongshore
   component of the coastal wind field. Interannual variations in
   the timing of the spring transition were reflected in this
   temporal amplitude time series. The second mode empirical
   orthogonal function described 11% of the variability in the
   data set. The spatial pattern revealed a north-south structure
   that appeared to be related to regional spatial variations in
   the strength of upwelling-favorable wind. The third empirical
   orthogonal function described only 3% of the data variability
   and the spatial structure suggested a meandering of the coastal
   surface flow. The results of this investigation indicate that
   the empirical orthogonal function method was effective at
   characterizing front the satellite data the dominant nearshore
   surface properties of die California Current System related to
   upwelling and rc;ind and by extension suggest that it is a
   suitable approach for remotely investigating other less well
   known easter boundary current systems. (C) Elsevier Science

TI Western boundary current separation: Inferences from a
   laboratory experiment
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Observations of a laboratory model of a western boundary
   current, and its separation and subsequent meandering, are
   described. The current is established by pumping fluid through
   a rotating channel that contains a topographic beta effect and
   continental slope topography. The observations are compared
   with a theoretical model of all three aspects of the current:
   the structure of the attached current, the process of
   separation, and the dynamics and path of the meandering jet.
   This model includes a viscous boundary layer for the attached
   current, with a thickness of order [nu/(d upsilon(I)/dy)](1/2),
   where nu is kinematic viscosity and d upsilon(I)/dy is the
   velocity gradient of the inviscid (free slip) flow along the
   boundary. Comparison between the observations and the model
   show that the attached boundary current is governed by
   potential vorticity conservation and the Bernoulli equation,
   and the pressure decreases along its length. The separation of
   this current from the sidewall is then caused by the minimum
   pressure level that is set by the downstream conditions in the
   tank, which forces the current into deeper water. The process
   is analogous to the separation of a boundary layer from a
   surface in an adverse pressure gradient in nonrotating flows.
   This process has implications for the separation of ocean
   boundary currents, where the derails are more complex but dear
   analogies exist. Meanders in the separated current are
   qualitatively consistent with an inertial jet model, although
   detached eddies attributable to instability are also observed.

TI A separating coastal upwelling jet at Cape Blanco, Oregon and
   its connection to the California Current System
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The coastal upwelling region near Cape Bianco, Oregon (43
   degrees N) off the west coast of the United States was studied
   using a towed CTD on SeaSoar, a shipboard acoustic Doppler
   current profiler (ADCP), satellite sea surface temperature maps
   and surface drifters during August 1995. The equatorward
   upwelling jet was inshore of the shelfbreak north of Cape
   Bianco, meandered gently offshore around the Cape, and then
   veered sharply offshore just to the south of the Cape. Analysis
   of vertical sections of density, velocity and "spiciness"
   confirmed the separation of an upwelling jet and front; the jet
   was followed from over the shelfbreak north of the Cape to 100
   km offshore downstream of the Cape. The separating jet
   originates from the coastal upwelling jet leaving the shelf,
   but is augmented by an offshore branching of the poleward
   undercurrent. By combining information from ADCP streamfunction
   maps with analysis of hydrographic data, including
   distributions of the tracer-like quantity "spiciness", a
   conceptual model of the three-dimensional circulation near the
   Cape emerges. A mid-shelf upwelling jet encounters a coastal
   promontory then turns offshore, stretching and deepening as it
   crosses the continental margin. The jet then turns back
   shoreward (cyclonically) where the deepened equatorward flow
   encounters the top of the poleward undercurrent flowing along
   the continental slope. This causes a portion of the
   undercurrent to turn offshore to join and strengthen the
   equatorward transport in the separated jet. Throughout the
   separation process the coastal upwelling front and jet are
   continuous, robust features. Separation of a coastal upwelling
   jet is an important mechanism for cross-shelf transport from
   the coast to the deep ocean. Cape Bianco appears to be the
   northernmost point where an equatorward jet regularly separates
   from the coast to become an oceanic jet and thus serves as the
   northern boundary of the region where an intense meandering
   current, characteristic of the California Current System, is
   found offshore. Drifters released late in the upwelling season
   are swept offshore and equatorward near the Cape. interact with
   the spatially complex circulation associated with the separated
   jet, and then return to the continental margin with the
   seasonal reversal in winds and near-surface currents. (C) 2000

TI Spectral light absorption and attenuation measurements from a
   towed undulating vehicle
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB Measurements from a nine-wavelength light absorption and
   attenuation instrument mounted on a towed, undulating vehicle
   (SeaSoar) capable of rapidly profiling the water column
   complete up-down cycles in 1.5-12 min depending on the maximum
   sampling depth - are used to characterize strong spatial
   variations in the distributions of upper-ocean biooptical
   properties. Water sampled from adjacent to the conductivity and
   temperature sensors located in the nose of the vehicle is
   pumped through the 25-cm dual optical flow tubes of a Western
   Environmental Technology Laboratories (WET Labs) ac-9
   instrument mounted on top of SeaSoar. A three-stage algorithm
   for post-processing the optical data to insure high-quality
   measurements concurrent with conductivity-temperature-depth
   data is described. After synchronizing the optical,
   navigational and conductivity-temperature-depth data streams,
   the method relies on finding the optimal time delay between
   when a water parcel is sampled first by the temperature and
   conductivity sensors and then by the absorption and attenuation
   optics. After applying the calculated rime-dependent lag, a
   correction for the dependence of light absorption on
   temperature and salinity and a scattering correction to
   absorption are made. The final processed optical data from
   SeaSoar compare well with the same parameters sampled by a
   slowly lowered vertical profiling package deployed from a
   nearby stationary vessel. A 2-h, 30-km long cross-shelf section
   consisting of 184 vertical profiles separated by 150-200 m
   reveals strong horizontal variations on short spatial scales (1
   km or less) of the vertical distributions of bio-optical
   properties. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   TYDSKRIF VIR SEEWETENSKAP
AB The coastal upwelling region near Cape Bianco (43 degreesN),
   Oregon, off the west coast of the United States, was studied
   using a towed conductivity-temperature-depth instrument on
   SeaSoar, a shipborne Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler,
   satellite sea surface temperature maps and satellite-tracked
   surface drifters during three cruises: August 1994, May and
   August 1995. Results demonstrate that the baroclinic coastal
   upwelling jet land associated front), which was over the shelf
   poleward of Cape Bianco in all three cruises, separates from
   the continental shelf, providing an important mechanism for
   transporting material across the continental margin to the deep
   ocean. This flow-topography interaction mechanism is a
   universal phenomenon, and is likely to be important in other
   eastern boundary current regions of the world. The observations
   from the two August cruises show two different phenomena. In
   1994, cyclogenesis was observed, during which the coastal jet
   was connected with a cyclonic eddy offshore before the
   connection was severed and the jet again flowed continuously
   around Cape Bianco but shifted eastwards. In 1995, the coastal
   jet meandered in the vicinity of Cape Bianco and then continued
   equatorward as an oceanic jet in deep water, but it was
   stronger and displaced farther seawards than the previous year.
   Drifters released early In the upwelling season (May 1995),
   when the strengthening longshore upwelling jet was only
   minimally perturbed by the Cape, were transported rapidly
   equatorwards and were swept through a large portion of the
   eastern boundary current region. Drifters released later in the
   upwelling season (August) were initially swept offshore and
   equatorwards near the Cape, but after interaction with the
   spatially complex mesoscale circulation, eventually returned to
   the continental margin with the seasonal reversal in winds and
   near-surface currents. These differing flow trajectories are
   likely to have a significant impact on the biology of eastern
   boundary currents.

TI The transition zone of the Canary Current upwelling region
SO PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Like all the major upwelling regions, the Canary Current is
   characterised by intense mesoscale structure in the transition
   zone between the cool, nutrient-rich waters of the coastal
   upwelling regime and the warmer, oligotrophic waters of the
   open ocean. The Canary Island archipelago, which straddles the
   transition, introduces a second source of Variability by per
   turbing the general southwestward flow of both ocean currents
   and Trade winds. The combined effects of the flow disturbance
   and the eddying and meandering of the boundary between upwelled
   and oceanic waters produce a complex pattern of regional
   variability. On the basis of historical data and a series of
   interdisciplinary field studies, the principal features of the
   region are described. These include a prominent upwelling
   filament originating near 28 degrees N off the African coast,
   cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies downstream of the
   archipelago, and warm wake regions protected from the Trade
   winds by the high Volcanic peaks of the islands. The filament
   is shown to be a recurrent feature, apparently arising from the
   interaction of a topographically trapped cyclonic eddy with the
   outer edge of the coastal upwelling zone. Its role in the
   transport and exchange of biogenic material, including fish
   larvae, is considered. Strong cyclonic eddies, observed
   throughout the year, drift slowly southwestward from Gran
   Canaria. One sampled in late summer was characterised by large
   vertical isopycnal displacements, apparent surface divergence
   and strong upwelling, producing a fourfold increase in
   chlorophyll concentrations over background values. Such intense
   eddies can be responsible for a major contribution to the
   vertical flux of nitrogen. The lee region of Gran Canaria is
   shown to be a location of strong pycnocline deformation
   resulting from Ekman pumping on the wind shear boundaries,
   which may contribute to the eddy formation process. (C) 1998

TI Seasonal climatology of hydrographic conditions in the
   upwelling region off northern Chile
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Over 30 years of hydrographic data from the northern Chile (18
   degreesS-24 degreesS) upwelling region are used to calculate
   the surface and subsurface seasonal climatology extending 400
   km offshore. The data are interpolated to a grid with
   sufficient spatial resolution to preserve cross-shelf gradients
   and then presented as means within four seasons: austral winter
   (July-September), spring (October-December), summer (January-
   March), and fall (April-June). Climatological monthly wind
   forcing, surface temperature, and sea level from three coastal
   stations indicate equatorward (upwelling favorable) winds
   throughout the year, weakest in the north. Seasonal maximum
   alongshore wind stress is in late spring and summer (December-
   March). Major water masses of the region are identified in
   climatological T-S plots and their sources and implied
   circulation discussed. Surface fields and vertical transects of
   temperature and salinity confirm that upwelling occurs year-
   round, strongest in summer and weakest in winter, bringing
   relatively fresh water to the surface nearshore. Surface
   geostrophic flow nearshore is equatorward throughout the year.
   During summer, an anticyclonic circulation feature in the north
   which extends to at least 200 m depth is evident in
   geopotential anomaly and in both temperature and geopotential
   variance fields. Subsurface fields indicate generally poleward
   flow throughout the year, strongest in an undercurrent near the
   coast. This undercurrent is strongest in summer and most
   persistent and organized in the south (south of 21 degreesS), A
   subsurface oxygen minimum, centered at similar to 250 m, is
   strongest at lower latitudes. Low-salinity subsurface water
   intrudes into the study area near 100 m, predominantly in
   offshore regions, strongest during summer and fall and in the
   southernmost portion of the region. The climatological fields
   are compared to features off Baja within the somewhat analogous
   California Current and to measurements from higher latitudes
   within the Chile-Peru Current system.

TI COASTAL OCEAN CIRCULATION NEAR BARBADOS, WEST-INDIES, SPRING
   1990 AND 1991
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Results are presented of two oceanographic surveys of the
   coastal waters surrounding Barbados, West Indies, during April
   and May of 1990 and 1991. In both years, observations of the
   hydrographic structure were made with a dense grid of
   conductivity-temperature-depth stations over the upper 500 m of
   the water column. Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP)
   measurements of currents in the upper 250 m were made on radial
   transects from the island during three short surveys in each
   year. One fixed mooring was deployed south of the island for
   the duration of each cruise. Results from both years showed the
   circulation to be energetic, highly variable over short
   timescales, and sometimes flowing contrary to historical means.
   Surface ADCP and geostrophic flow patterns during 1990
   suggested that the Barbados Ridge, north of the island, played
   an important role in steering the circulation north of the
   island. The sudden reversal of the current south of the island
   between legs 1 and 2 of 1990, coupled with the presence of low-
   salinity surface water, suggested we may have witnessed an
   encounter between the island and the northern edge of a thin
   (less than 35 m) mesoscale pool of Brazilian Current
   retroflexion region origin. On the other hand, in 1991, several
   eddies, both cyclonic and anticyclonic, were observed near the
   island, suggesting the possibility of shedding of Von Karman
   type eddies from the island.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE-SUID-AFRIKAANSE
   TYDSKRIF VIR SEEWETENSKAP
AB The near-surface flow off the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, was
   monitored weekly along a 60 km transect between August 1995 and
   July 1996 as part of the South African Sardine and Anchovy
   Recruitment Programme. Measurements from small vessels were
   made by means of tracking drogues by GPS (sometimes
   differentially corrected) and by an Acoustic Doppler Current
   Profiler (ADCP) when sampling from large vessels. The currents
   responded to the presence of Agulhas water, to wind-forcing and
   to barotropic shelf waves. The results suggest a marked
   seasonality in the position and amount of equatorward and
   poleward flow, which needs to be confirmed. Strong north-
   westward flow close inshore was measured in spring (August-
   October), turning into the "classic" formation of an
   equatorward jet, with variable barotropic flow inshore in early
   summer. In summer, circulation patterns became more complex,
   with marked southward flow. From February to April, the front
   was generally far offshore and often not encountered on the
   transect. Examples of the variability of the flow on a week-by-
   week basis are provided and are related to the thermal
   structure and to the wind record from Cape Point. The
   seasonality of the flow is summarized in terms of estimated
   mean surface transport per two-month period, and a series of
   northward and southward components for each cruise throughout
   the year is provided.

TI CIRCULATION OVER THE SHELF AND SLOPE OFF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Hydrographic observations taken during the Northern California
   Coastal Circulation Study (NCCCS) are analyzed to examine the
   structure and variability of density and velocity over the
   shelf and slope, to a distance of 70 km offshore and a depth of
   1500 m. Cross-shore sections with closely spaced stations were
   occupied between the Oregon border and San Francisco seven
   times between March 1987 and October 1989. Historical
   observations from CalCOFI line 60 off Point Reyes are also
   analyzed to provide better resolution of seasonal and
   interannual variability in the region than is available from
   the NCCCS data. Poleward flow dominates the circulation in this
   easternmost part of the California Current system, much mom so
   than the historical description would indicate. Because there
   is substantial poleward shear below 500-m depth, poleward
   transports in the top 500 m referred to 1500-m depth are 2 to 5
   times the values referred to 500 m. Equatorward flow occurs on
   average over the shelf, and in an organized fashion offshore.
   The shelf flows appear to be the local response to wind-driven
   upwelling. The offshore equatorward flow is an energetic,
   narrow feature that persists for several months at a time and
   has alongshore structure aligned to die shape of the coastline.
   It can be identified in one of the NCCCS surveys as the same
   jet described by the 1988 Coastal Transition Zone experiment
   observations. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis indicates
   that seasonal variability in the top 500 m of the water column
   generally explains less variance (approximately 20%) than does
   interannual variability (approximately 50%). Between 500 and
   1500 m, seasonal fluctuations explain a greater proportion of
   the variance (approximately 50%). The shape of the coastline,
   the coastal mountains, and the bathymetry of the shelf and
   slope have a significant influence on the circulation in this
   region. There is enhanced upwelling near the two major capes
   (Mendocino and Point Arena), as well as substantial increases
   in poleward transports near both. Flow is directed offshore on
   the north sides of both features and onshore to the south. The
   equatorward flowing offshore jet is found closer to shore in
   the embayment between the two capes and farther offshore at the
   latitude of the capes.

TI Intraseasonal oscillations in sea surface temperature, wind
   stress, and sea level off the central California coast
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB The wavelet transform is used to conduct spectral and cross-
   spectral analysis of daily time series of sea surface
   temperature (SST), surface wind stress, and sea level off the
   central California coast for an 18-year period from 1974
   through 1991. The spectral band of primary interest is given by
   intraseasonal time scales ranging from 30 to 70 days. Using the
   wavelet transform, we examine the evolutionary behavior of the
   frequently observed 40-50 day oscillation originally discovered
   in the tropics by Madden and Julian, and explore the relative
   importance of atmospheric vs oceanic forcing for a range of
   periods where both could be important. Wavelet power spectra of
   each variable reveal the event-like, nonstationary nature of
   the intraseasonal band. Peaks in wavelet power typically last
   for 3-4 months and occur, on average, approximately once every
   18 months. Thus, their occurrence and/or duration off central
   California is somewhat reduced in comparison to their presence
   in the tropics. Although peaks in wind stress often coincide
   with peaks in SST and/or sea level, no consistent relationships
   between the variables was initially apparent. The spectra
   suggest, however, that relationships between the variables, if
   and where they do exist, are event-dependent and thus have time
   scales of the same order. Cross-wavelet spectra between wind
   stress and SST indicate that periods of high coherence (> 0.90)
   occur on at least six occasions over the 18-year period of
   record. Phase differences tend to be positive, consistent with
   wind forcing. For wind stress vs sea level, the cross-wavelet
   spectra indicate that periods of high coherence, which tend to
   correlate with lags close to zero, also occur, but are less
   frequent. As with SST, the periods of high coherence usually
   coincide with events in the wavelet power spectra. The somewhat
   weaker relationship between wind stress and sea level may be
   due to an independent contribution to sea level through remote
   forcing by the ocean originating in the tropics. Finally,
   simple dynamical arguments regarding the lag relationships
   between the variables appear to be consistent with the cross-
   wavelet results. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

TI A view of the 1993-1994 California Current based on surface
   drifters, floats, and remotely sensed data
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Near-surface drifters were deployed in the California Current
   System during the period 1993-1994 in order to study mean and
   eddy currents. The deployment scheme allowed a 2 year period
   where data density was high enough to make meaningful estimates
   of eddy statistics and of seasonal mean currents and variances
   on a 5 degrees grid. Eddy variability, which tended to be
   isotropic, was higher near the coast (standard deviations
   around 0.2 m s(-1)) and decreased offshore (down to similar to
   0.1 m s(-1)). Seasonal mean surface flow west of California was
   southward during all seasons: if a Davidson Current existed
   during 1993-1995, it was probably either short-lived or only
   found closer to the coast than our study area, i.e., within
   100-150 km of shore. In some cases, drifter populations within
   a discrete feature were high enough to allow some detailed
   resolution of its behavior. We note a tendency for individual
   eddies (which can last for up to 3-5 months) to drift westward
   at rates of O(5 km day-1). Not all eddies in the region are
   surface-intensified. There is clear evidence for at least the
   occasional presence of a thin, meandering southward jet in the
   region that can be 1000 km or more long. This jet can be
   identified with that found in the Coastal Transition Zone
   program in association with cool filaments. The jet appears to
   become broader and slower south of Point Conception. We
   hypothesize (on the basis of others' results as well as ours)
   that the eddies that are strongest at the surface result
   primarily from instabilities on a southward alongshore mean
   current and that eddies that are maximal at depth are spawned
   by the northward undercurrent.

TI Mesoscale circulation features of the Great Barrier Reef region
   inferred from NOAA satellite imagery
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB The commissioning of a NOAA satellite receiving station at
   Townsville in North Queensland in 1988 greatly expanded the
   AVHRR coverage of the northeast Australian region to include
   the entire Great Barrier Reef system and marginal seas.
   Selected imagery from this and a southern station installed
   previously at Aspendale, Victoria provide a valuable new
   perspective on oceanographic phenomena occurring in this
   ecologically significant region. This perspective could not be
   attained using conventional ship-board and in situ
   oceanographic sampling techniques. A rich spectrum of mesoscale
   oceanographic features is revealed in the analyzed imagery, and
   various features such as western boundary current meanders,
   frontal shear waves, eddies, and jets are described. The
   temporal and spatial variability of these features appears
   strongly linked to that of the larger-scale Coral Sea current
   circulation. Several of the features identified are unique to
   the region, others resemble features observed in other western
   boundary current systems, but are significantly modified by the
   complex regional topography, and by the presence of the Great
   Barrier Reef (GBR). Evidence has been found for a number of
   processes which have significant implications for the origin
   and maintenance of CBR ecosystems, including shelf edge
   exchange processes, stratified slope water intrusions onto the
   shelf, and boundary layer mixing around reefs. Such processes
   provide a mechanism for injection of cool nutrient-rich waters
   into the reef matrix. The imagery provides a clear picture of a
   well-organized, but spatially complex, frontal system existing
   in the southern Coral Sea, which is associated with enhanced
   commercial and recreational fishing activity in the region. The
   AVHRR imagery has thus proven to be a valuable tool for spatial
   mapping of oceanographic features throughout the CBR region,
   for hypothesis formation in dynamical and modeling studies, and
   for ship-board reconnaissance operations.

TI A NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF CIRCULATION IN THE ARABIAN GULF
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model is developed to study
   the circulation in the Arabian Gulf. The model contains
   realistic basin geometries and bathymetries of the Arabian Gulf
   and a good portion of the Gulf of Oman and is driven by monthly
   climatological winds, evaporation, and net ocean heat gain in
   both gulfs and the Shatt-al-Arab discharge. It is found that
   the cyclonic circulation in the southern portion of the gulf is
   primarily driven by the evaporation-induced freshening from the
   Strait of Hormuz. In the northwestern comer of the gulf, the
   Shatt-al-Arab discharge maintains the cyclonic circulation,
   which would other-wise be anticyclonic. The northwestward
   intrusion of fresher water along the Iranian coast is weakened
   by northwesterly winds in winter but strengthens and extends
   almost to the head of the gulf in summer owing to the warming
   of the Gulf of Oman waters, the development of the summer
   thermocline in the Arabian Gulf, and diminishing winds. The
   southward coastal current along the Arabian coast is most
   prominent between the head of the gulf and Qatar. The model
   also predicts a strong southward coastal jet east of Qatar
   which is primarily wind driven. No similar coastal jet can be
   developed in the Gulf of Salwa, west of Qatar.

TI HORIZONTAL TRANSPORT AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF NUTRIENTS IN THE
   COASTAL TRANSITION ZONE OFF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - EFFECTS ON
   PRIMARY PRODUCTION, PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS AND SPECIES
   COMPOSITION
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Conductivity-temperature-depth surveys during 1988 encountered
   strong baroclinic jets that were evident in acoustic Doppler
   current profiler and hydrographic data.  During June and July
   1988 a filament with high surface nitrate, high chlorophyll,
   abundant populations of neritic centric diatoms, and higher
   rates of primary production was evident perpendicular to the
   coast between Point Arena and Point Reyes.  However, the high-
   nutrient and phytoplankton regions were not in the baroclinic
   jets but were south and inshore of them.  Surface water
   transported offshore by the strong baroclinic jets was found to
   have relatively low nutrient content, suggesting that the jets
   themselves do not carry significant levels of coastally
   upwelled, high-nutrient water to the ocean interior.  The low
   nutrient and salinity content of the jet suggests that the
   water originated several hundred kilometers upstream.  Although
   the jets themselves do not appear to transport significant
   levels of nutrients directly from the coastal regime to the
   oceanic regime, dynamic processes associated with a meandering
   jet are likely responsible for high surface nutrients found
   several hundred kilometers offshore.  Processes such as
   upwelling along the sourthern edge of the seaward jet result in
   significant enrichment of the coastal transition zone and in
   large blooms of neritic diatoms.  During 1988 the high-
   nutrient, high-phytoplankton filament was present when the
   survey sequence began but then decayed after a month.  The
   surface and subsurface nitrate fields were coherent with the
   dynamic topography field throughout the survey sequence;
   however, the surface and integrated chlorophyll fields were
   coherent only through the first two surveys.  A decrease in
   phytoplankton biomass began during the third survey coincident
   with physical changes which occurred in that time frame:  (1)
   an intensification of the undercurrent and (2) changes in the
   surface circulation from predominantly offshore to
   predominantly longshore.  Understanding the processes
   responsible for the uncoupling between biology and physics is
   paramount for realistic biological model of this region.

TI VARIABILITY OF CURRENTS IN LATE SPRING IN THE NORTHERN GREAT
   SOUTH CHANNEL
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB The residual flows computed from detided shipboard ADCP data
   collected in late spring 1988 and 1989 clearly show different
   circulation patterns in the near-surface and deeper regions in
   the Great South Channel (GSC). In the upper 50 m, the residual
   flow in the northern GSC consists of three principal currents:
   (1) a southward coastal current located along the western flank
   of the GSC; (2) a broad cyclonic circulation crudely following
   the local topography in the interior region of the northern
   GSC; and (3) a northeastward current along the western flank of
   Georges Bank. Below 50 m, the residual flow tends to be
   cyclonic along the local 100-m isobath in the northern GSC.
   These circulation patterns are consistent with the vertical
   distributions of water properties and the trajectories of
   satellite-tracked drifters drogued at 5 and 50 m. Comparisons
   with geostrophic current shears and numerical model results
   suggest that the residual flow in spring is driven primarily by
   tidal rectification over the shallower sides of the northern
   GSC and by buoyancy forcing over the deeper flanks of the GSC.
   The southward transports of low-salinity plume surface water
   and Maine Intermediate Water (MIW) were about 0.07 +/- 0.03 Sv
   and 0.31 +/- 0.38 Sv in April 1988 and about 0.12 +/- 0.06 Sv
   and 0.66 +/- 0.14 Sv in June 1989. The larger transports of
   low-salinity plume water and MIW found in June 1989 are
   believed to be due to the increased freshwater river discharge
   in 1989 and occurrence of a subsurface coastal jet current
   along the western flank of the GSC.

TI Absolute and convective instabilities of plane turbulent wakes
   in a shallow water layer
SO JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
AB In shallow turbulent wake flows (typically an island wake), the
   flow patterns have been found experimentally to depend mainly
   on a shallow wake parameter, S=c(f)D/h in which c(f) is a
   quadratic-law friction coefficient, D is the island diameter
   and h is water depth. In order to understand the dependence of
   flow patterns on S, the shallow-water stability equation (a
   modified Orr-Sommerfeld equation) has been derived from the
   depth-averaged equations of motion with terms which describe
   bottom friction. Absolute and convective instabilities have
   been investigated on the basis of wake velocity profiles with a
   velocity deficit parameter R. Numerical computations have been
   carried out for a range of R-values and a stability diagram
   with two dividing lines was obtained, one defining the boundary
   between absolute and convective instabilities S-ca, and another
   defining the transition between convectively unstable and
   stable wake flow S-cc. The experimental measurements (Chen &
   Jirka 1995) of return velocities in shallow wakes were used to
   compute R-values and two critical values, S-A = 0.79 and S-C =
   0.85, were obtained at the intersections with lines S-ca and S-
   cc. Through comparison with transition values observed
   experimentally for wakes with unsteady bubble (recirculation
   zone) and vortex shedding, S-U and S-V respectively, the
   sequence SC>SASU>S-V shows vortex shedding to be the end
   product of absolute instability. This is analogous to the
   sequence of critical Reynolds numbers for an unbounded wake of
   large spanwise extent. Experimental frequency characteristics
   compare well with theoretical results. The observed values of
   S-U and S-V for different flow patterns correspond to the
   velocity profile with R = -0.945, which is located at the end
   of the wake bubble, and it provides the dominant mode.

TI BIFURCATION FOR FLOW PAST A CYLINDER BETWEEN PARALLEL PLANES
SO JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
AB Numerical experiments are described to ascertain how the steady
   flow past a circular cylinder loses stability as the Reynolds
   number is increased. A novel feature of the present study is
   that the cylinder is confined between parallel planes, allowing
   a more definitive specification of the flow, both
   experimentally and computationally, than is possible for the
   unbounded case. Since the structure of the bifurcation is
   unclear from the extant literature, with the experimental and
   computational evidence not in good agreement, a critical
   appraisal of both sets of evidence is presented. A study has
   been made of the formation of the steady vortex pair behind the
   cylinder, and it has been determined that the first appearance
   of the vortices is not associated with a bifurcation of the
   full dynamical problem but instead it is probably associated
   with a bifurcation of a restricted kinematical problem. A set
   of numerical experiments has been made in which the steady flow
   past the cylinder was perturbed slightly and the ensuing time-
   dependent motions were computed. These experiments revealed
   that, for a given blockage ratio, the perturbation would die
   away at small Reynolds numbers but that, above a critical
   Reynolds number, the disturbance would be amplified and the
   flow would eventually settle down to a new state comprising a
   time-periodic motion. Experiments were also carried out to
   determine the bifurcation point numerically by considering an
   eigenvalue problem based on a linearization about the computed
   steady flow past the cylinder. The calculations showed that
   stability is lost through a symmetry-breaking Hopf bifurcation
   and that, for a given blockage ratio, the critical Reynolds
   number was in very good agreement with that estimated from the
   time-dependent computations.

TI The non-wavelike response of a continental shelf to wind
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH
AB An overlooked aspect of continental shelf wave generation by
   wind is that a non-wavelike flow field may accompany the waves.
   To explore this possibility, we calculate the response of an
   inclined plane shelf to suddenly applied alongshore wind,
   affecting a finite portion of the coast. The calculations are
   based on the classical theory of continental shelf waves,
   supposing low frequency motions and invoking the boundary layer
   approximation (alongshore scales much longer than cross-shore
   ones). The results reveal non-wavelike circulations, with or
   without bottom friction, on a shelf of finite or unlimited
   width, unaffected by changing offshore boundary conditions. in
   the frictionless case, the principal new feature is an
   accelerating coastal jet that feeds offshore Ekman transport,
   drawing the fluid from the outer shelf of the downwave half-
   space. Continental shelf waves accompany the coastal jet on a
   shelf of finite width, their properties varying with the shelf-
   edge boundary condition. With bottom friction, the non-wavelike
   circulation has the character of an "arrested topographic
   wave," a steady-state Row that develops on a gradually
   expanding portion of the inner shelf. This takes over the role
   of the coastal jet in the frictionless solution and satisfies
   mass balance by feeding offshore or onshore Ekman transport.
   The outer shelf is occupied by time-dependent closed
   circulations.

TI The hydraulics of an evolving upwelling jet flowing around a
   cape
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Upwelling jets flow alongshore in approximate geostrophic
   balance with the onshore pressure gradient induced by coastal
   upwelling. Observations of such jets have shown that they often
   move offshore downstream of capes, leaving a pool of upwelled
   water inshore. Comparisons are made between this behavior and
   the hydraulic transition of a potential-vorticity-conserving
   coastal current as it passes a topographic anomaly at which it
   is exactly critical to long coastal-trapped waves. An analytic
   1.5-layer model of coastal hydraulics with constant potential
   vorticity in each layer predicts flow fields (i.e., jet
   separation) in critical situations that resemble observations.
   When scales approximate Cape Blanco on the Oregon coast,
   separation occurs at a jet transport of around 0.76 x 10(6)
   m(3) s(-1), similar to observed transports. Time-dependent,
   semigeostrophic calculations suggest that, during an upwelling
   season, the jet would evolve from a weak flow, which was
   subcritical everywhere and symmetric about the cape, to an
   exactly critical state that made a transition from subcritical
   to supercritical structure at the head of the cape. The
   predicted flow field at critical transition consists of a
   narrow upwelling jet upstream of the cape that moves offshore
   and broadens at the cape. This critical state would be
   accompanied by a downstream jump back to subcritical
   conditions. Further upwelling-favorable winds would lead to
   transient waves that propagated upstream and downstream,
   modifying the upstream and downstream conditions and restoring
   criticality. Thus, the head of the cape exerts hydraulic
   control on the flow and prevents the jet transport from
   increasing above its critical level. Inherent in the hydraulic
   approach is the assumption that alongshore scales are large.
   For realistic alongshore scales, solutions modified by
   coastline curvature suggest that the convexity of the head of a
   cape slightly inhibits the transition to a strongly upwelled
   downstream state by increasing the required critical transport.
   In the presence of topographic features with finite alongshore
   scale, the hydraulic approach can be used to construct a flow
   field, although this flow field has an inherent error arising
   from the implicit assumptions regarding scales. Estimation of
   this error for topography representing Cape Blanco suggests
   that in places the cape is rather abrupt for hydraulic theory
   to be valid.

TI EDDY FORMATION BEHIND A COASTAL HEADLAND
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The two-dimensional steady Bow of a coastal flow past a
   headland has been considered. Results from a numerical model
   are presented to show the transient and steady state flow
   structures downstream of the headland, for a range of external
   parameters. It is demonstrated that the flows are of two types.
   The first type, which is characterised by low values of the
   bottom friction parameter (M) and low values of the Froude
   number (Fr), shows deflection of the incident flow around the
   cape tip and attachment of the flow to the rear face of the
   headland. For higher values of M and Fr, separation of the flow
   occurs at the tip of the headland and an attached eddy is
   generated downstream. Eddy shedding is not observed. The
   results show that the size of the attached eddy and the
   vorticity distribution within it are controlled strongly by the
   value of M, though the maximum vorticity within the eddy
   depends only upon the incident flow velocity U and the
   horizontal dimension L of the obstruction. Evidence of
   oscillatory behaviour is detected during the transient
   adjustment phase of flow development, with the period of the
   oscillations being of the same order as vortex shedding periods
   for the same geometry.

TI A 3-DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF THE WATER CIRCULATION AROUND AN ISLAND
   IN SHALLOW-WATER
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB A three-dimensional model is applied to the study of the tidal
   flow in the shallow waters around Rattray Island, Great Barrier
   Reef, Australia. The model uses the sigma-coordinate system and
   the numerical procedure is based on the finite volume approach.
   Two counter-rotating eddies develop in the wake of the island.
   The shearing and veering of the horizontal velocity is
   predicted to be small, hence the vertical motions are
   negligible almost everywhere, with the exception of some small
   regions. In the center of the eddies important upwelling is
   found, which is in qualitative agreement with theory and
   observations. The model exhibits strong downwelling along the
   upstream side of the island. Overall, the magnitude of the
   computed vertical motions may be too small and it is
   hypothesized that this may be due to a lack of resolution of
   the model. Further improvements to the model are outlined.

TI EFFECTS OF VISCOSITY AND BOTTOM FRICTION ON RECIRCULATING-FLOWS
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB A recent set of coastal experiments (Pattiaratchi et al.,
   1987), found that the horizontal eddy Reynolds number did not
   adequately describe the wakes found in the lee of coastal
   islands. Other flow parameters formulated on bottom friction
   were found to be much better at describing these wakes. In this
   paper it is suggested that these findings are caused by the
   extraction of energy froin the flow due to bottom friction,
   which is the net result of the vertical viscous transfer of
   momentum through the water column to the seabed. This is in
   contrast to the horizontal viscous transfer of momentum which
   results in negligible energy loss to the coast, because of the
   far larger horizontal scales. It is hypothesized that this
   difference results in fundamentally different flow regimes and
   this hypothesis is investigated both analytically and
   numerically. Conditions for the existence of steady zones of
   barotropic recirculation under the influence of both horizontal
   viscosity and bottom friction in the wake behind a bluff body
   are examined analytically. It is found that such steady
   recirculation requires the presence of horizontal viscosity and
   is hindered by the loss of energy due to bottom friction. A
   numerical model is used to verify and quantify this analytical
   result for the case of two-dimensional flow around a circular
   cylinder, and it is concluded that an appropriate bottom
   friction number, based on the ratio of scales of the nonlinear
   and bottom friction terms, may often govern the nature of the
   recirculation in the lee of coastal islands, instead of the
   eddy Reynolds number based on horizontal eddy viscosity, as is
   sometimes assumed.

TI STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF A COASTAL FILAMENT
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Repeated microstructure transects across filaments in the
   coastal transition zone (CTZ) have revealed fundamental
   structure and dynamics of the complicated features.  The
   measurements allow detailed momentum and vorticity analyses and
   provide a possible explanations for structural asymmetry of the
   fronts.  Observations made between July 2 and July 23, 1988,
   along the central meridional CTZ survey line were used to
   estimate terms in the meridional momentum equation.  The
   analysis indicates geostrophic flow along the axes of the
   fronts with the across-front pressure gradient explaining as
   much as 87% of the variance in the balance.  Significant
   ageostrophic flow in the across-front coordinate was found,
   with the along-front pressure gradient explaining only 71% of
   the variance in the momentum balance.  The fronts were found to
   be asymmetric in relative vorticity, with stronger positive
   vorticity on the cooler side of the front and weaker negative
   vorticity on the warm side.  Mean vertical velocities were
   estimated from the repeated transects of acoustic Doppler
   current profiles and the rapid sampling vertical profiler
   hydrographic and turbulence measurements.  Regions of upwelling
   and downwelling are likely associated with adjustments in the
   relative vorticity, resulting in maximum vertical velocities of
   40 m d-1.  Asymmetry in the near-surface temperature and
   salinity extrema are explained by cross-frontal exchange.  This
   cross-frontal exchange modifies the relative roles of salinity
   and temperature in determining the density away from the
   coastal upwelling region, a dynamically important
   characteristic not revealed by advanced very high resolution
   radiometer imagery.

TI Global high-resolution mapping of ocean circulation from
   TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-1 and-2
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB This study focuses on the improved estimation of mesoscale
   surface ocean circulation obtained by merging TOPEX/Poseidon
   (T/P) and ERS-1 and -2 altimeter measurements between October
   1992 and May 1998. Once carefully intercalibrated and
   homogenized, these data are merged through an advanced global
   objective analysis method that allows us to correct for
   residual long wavelength errors and uses realistic correlation
   scales of ocean dynamics, The high-resolution (0.25 degrees x
   0.25 degrees) merged T/P + ERS-1 and -2 sea level anomaly maps
   provide more homogeneous and reduced mapping errors than either
   individual data set and more realistic sea level and
   geostrophic velocity statistics than T/P data alone.
   Furthermore, the merged T/P + ERS-1 and -2 maps yield eddy
   kinetic energy (EKE) levels 30% higher than maps of T/P alone.
   They also permit realistic global estimates of east and north
   components of EKE and their seasonal variations, to study EKE
   sources better. A comparison of velocity statistics with World
   Ocean Circulation Experiment surface drifters in the North
   Atlantic shows very good agreement. Comparison with
   contemporary current meter data in various oceanic regimes also
   produces comparable levels of energy and similar ratios of
   northward and eastward energy, showing that the maps are
   suitable to studying anisotropy. The T/P + ERS zonal and
   meridional components of the mapped currents usually present
   comparable rms variability, even though the variability in the
   Atlantic is more isotropic than that in the Pacific, which
   exhibits strong zonal changes. The EKE map presents a very
   detailed description, presumably never before achieved at a
   global scale. Pronounced seasonal changes of the EKE are found
   in many regions, notably the northeastern Pacific, the
   northeastern and northwestern Atlantic, the tropical oceans,
   and the zonally extended bands centered near 20 degrees S in
   the Indian and western Pacific Oceans and at 20 degrees N in
   the northwestern nl Pacific.

TI UPWELLING CIRCULATION ON THE OREGON CONTINENTAL-SHELF .2.
   SIMULATIONS AND COMPARISONS WITH OBSERVATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Sixty-day simulations of flow on the Oregon continental shelf
   are performed using the Blumberg and Mellor sigma coordinate,
   primitive equation model. The model is two-dimensional (an
   across-shelf section) with high spatial resolution and
   realistic shelf topography. Forcing consists of surface heat
   flux, either hourly or low-pass filtered wind stress, and in
   one case, a constant alongshore pressure gradient. Model
   results are compared with current and hydrographic measurements
   from the CUE-2 program. The horizontal scale of the alongshore
   coastal jet is significantly influenced by the structure of the
   initial density and velocity fields. The model successfully
   reproduces the vertical shear in the alongshore velocity field
   v, but the model's mean v field is too strongly southward, and
   the variance in both the u and v fields is underpredicted.
   Inclusion of the alongshore pressure gradient, while improving
   prediction of the mean alongshore velocities, does not improve
   the model-data correlation. The time-mean model density agrees
   with observations at middepths over the shelf, but shows larger
   values than observed near the surface. The results demonstrate
   the importance of including a surface heat flux and of
   specifying realistic initial density and alongshore velocity
   fields.

TI The shear, convergence, and thermohaline structure of a front
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB With the objective of measuring convergence directly to confirm
   previous observations of frontal subduction, a seaward
   upwelling jet off central California was studied using
   satellite infrared images, hydrographic sections, ship drift,
   and clusters of surface drifters. The cyclonic front of the jet
   was sharper than 1 km, resulting in a shear several times
   larger than f. A cross-frontal convergence of 7 cm s(-1) over
   the width of the front (equivalent to 0.8f) was visible as a
   20-m-wide accumulation of debris. The sharpness of the front
   lasted at least for a day. Away from the cyclonic front, the
   divergence of the flow was small and the shear was less than
   0.6f Thermohaline layers, originating at the front, were
   interleaving along isopycnals, suggesting water subduction, It
   is proposed that the asymetry between anticyclonic and cyclonic
   sides of the jet, and the strong convergence at the cyclonic
   front, resulted from a frictionally driven ageostrophic
   secondary circulation superimposed on the geostrophic Row.

TI EXPORT PRODUCTION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF FISH LARVAE AND THEIR
   PREY IN A COASTAL JET FRONTAL REGION
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
AB Fine-scale spatial sampling series and vertical cross-sections
   were used to obtain quasisynoptic images of the distribution of
   fish larvae and their prey in the permanent frontal region
   formed by the Gaspe coastal jet current and the adjacent
   Anticosti gyre (NW Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada). The
   accumulation of large diatoms triggered the reproduction of
   copepods in the Gaspe current where eggs and nauplii (the main
   prey of first-feeding fish larvae) were 10 to 20 times more
   abundant than in the gyre. Estuarine circulation resulted in
   the coincidence of the small and abundant larvae of capelin
   Mallotus villosus and sand lance Ammodytes sp. with this
   intense production of their food in the jet current. The large
   and less abundant larvae of redfish Sebastes sp. and Arctic
   shanny Stichaeus punctatus exploited the scarcer food resources
   of the Anticosti gyre. We conclude that opportunistic species
   producing large numbers of small offspring with limited
   foraging skills depend on massive export production at
   hydrographic singularities (i.e. salient hydrographic features)
   for reproduction. Species producing fewer but larger and more
   competent larvae can colonize less productive areas of the
   ocean. Plankton dynamics in the dispersal area of the early
   larval stages appear to be a primary constraint defining the
   life strategy of a fish species.

TI A numerical study of the Lagrangian circulation in the Gulf of
   California
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB The advection of particles is studied numerically in order to
   obtain patterns of the Lagrangian circulation in the Gulf of
   California during the two major seasons in the gulf. A two-
   dimensional vertically integrated model is used to generate the
   velocity fields. The forcing agents are the principal lunar
   ride specified at the mouth of the gulf and wind stresses
   representative of summer and winter conditions. The flow
   geometry, i.e., the set of stagnation points and their
   associated streamlines, is computed for the mean velocity field
   of each season. These geometries show the well-known features
   of the gulf's surface circulation: A cyclonic gyre during
   summer (anticyclonic in winter) in the northern gulf; and a up-
   gulf coastal jet on the mainland side during summer (down-gulf
   in winter) in the southern gulf. It is shown that these mean-
   flow geometries govern the advection of the total velocity
   field for time scales much longer than the tidal period. The
   seasonal gyres of the northern gulf effectively trap particles
   for periods of up to two months. The along-shore flows of the
   southern gulf transport particles over hundreds of kilometers.

TI Shallow-water frictional effects in island wakes
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB Only one eddy is present in the island wake in the lee of
   Rattray Island, a 1600 m wide island in shallow coastal waters
   off Australia. This observation is contrary to the predictions
   of a number of two- and three-dimensional, fixed grid,
   numerical models which all predict that two eddies are present,
   one eddy being shed from each of the two tips of the island.
   The discrete vortex model suggests this observation results
   from the frictional effects in sub-grid scale details of the
   topography close to the tips of the island. This model also
   successfully reproduces the observations of a Karman vortex
   street in the lee of islands in Rupert Bay, Canada. By
   contrast, fixed-grid models predict no such eddy shedding.
   Island wakes are thus sensitive to details of the bathymetry
   near the separation points and these must be either
   parameterized in fixed grid models, whether regular or boundary
   fitted, or explicitly calculated in non-fixed grid models such
   as the discrete vortex model. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

TI Sensitivity study of an upper ocean model in a coastal bay
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB An upper layer ocean model, with primitive equation dynamics

   Entrainment and detrainment in the mixed layer are determined
   from wind and buoyancy turbulent kinetic energy, as well as the
   effect of shear instability at the base of the mixed layer. The
   model parameterised the processes of convection and deep ocean
   diffusion, as well as mass entrainment at a subsurface layer
   due to strong upwelling. It was applied to the Bale des
   Chaleurs (Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada). The model was forced
   by observed winds, atmospheric heat fluxes, river runoff and a
   remote coastal jet. The simulations in the main run reproduced
   well the observational fields in both time and space.
   Sensitivity runs are conducted to study the effects of external

TI On the unsteady separation/intrusion of the Gaspe current and
   variability in Baie des Chaleurs: Modeling studies
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB A numerical model has been used to study separation/intrusion
   of an unsteady, baroclinic coastal jet, the Gaspe Current (GC)
   and its impact on dynamics and thermodynamics of the Bale des
   Chaleurs (BdC, Gulf St; Lawrence, Canada). The model has 2 1/2
   layers with primitive equation dynamics and an embedded bulk
   mixed layer (ML) model. It is forced with observed atmospheric
   fluxes, as well as the GC. The simulations show that the
   variability in the Bale des Chaleurs is controlled by the
   characteristics of the unsteady GC separation/intrusion. On the
   basis of the dynamic and vorticity balance analyses, it is
   found that the separation is related to the adverse pressure
   gradient force which is induced by the ageostrophic terms in
   the momentum equations and to local vorticity intensification
   due to the inertial effect in the flow. The simulations
   demonstrate characteristics of unsteady separation. The
   presence of separation in an accelerating current, as well as,
   in a linear current, with strong deceleration when momentum
   advection is neglected, gives new insight into the mechanisms
   of unsteady boundary, current separation. Unsteady separation
   or intrusion occurrence depends on the magnitude of the,GC
   transport, as well as its rate and duration of deceleration or
   acceleration. The GC intrusion generates cyclonic circulation
   in the BdC. Prevailing westerly winds reduce the cyclonic
   circulation inside the bay but have little effect on
   separation/intrusion near the entrance. The GC either intrudes
   along the coastline (attachment) or after separation
   (reattachment). Increasing vertical shear of the GC and
   offshore movement of the GC axis reduces the tendency to
   separate. The finding of an asymmetric response of GC
   separation/intrusion to symmetric GC forcing explains the
   monthly mean features seen in observations taken in the bay.

TI Diagnostic analysis of the 3D ageostrophic circulation from a
   multivariate spatial interpolation of CTD and ADCP data
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB A multivariate (MV) optimal statistical interpolation method is
   applied to conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and ship-
   mounted acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) data from
   quasi-synoptic oceanographic surveys. MV analysis aims to
   improve the spatial interpolation of any particular variable
   (e.g., dynamic height) by including in the analysis
   observations of other physically related variables (e.g.,
   current). The version used in this work also provides estimates
   of the non-divergent and irrotational components of the flow.
   The method is tested in a sharp frontal region to the north of
   the Western Alboran gyre. After deriving the optimal analysis
   parameters, we first show that MV statistical dynamic height
   analysis errors are significantly smaller than those derived
   from univariate (UV) analysis. In our region, this translates
   in a more realistic shape for the geostrophic relative
   vorticity and the vertical velocity field. The latter peaks at
   about 45 m/day (as given by the quasi-geostrophic omega
   equation), with a tendency for light water to be upwelled
   upstream of the gyre while denser water is downwelled
   downstream of the gyre. For the horizontal velocity we show the
   existence of large (up to 40 cm/s) ageostrophic velocities,
   These are mainly non-divergent and can be explained by the
   cyclostrophic acceleration induced by the anticyclonic gyre.
   The irrotational velocity component is of the order of 10 cm/s
   towards the dense side of the front. The robustness of the
   method is checked by means of several tests that evaluate the
   sensitivity of results with respect to the synopticity of the
   data, the analysis parameters, the reference level and the
   presence of tidal or inertial currents. (C) 2000 Elsevier

TI THE EFFECT OF BOTTOM FRICTION ON SHALLOW-WATER FLOW PAST AN
   ISOLATED OBSTACLE
SO JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
AB The effect of bottom friction on fluid flow past an isolated
   obstacle is investigated in the shallow-water framework. The
   controlling parameter for this effect is the nondimensional
   bottom friction number, defined as a ratio of friction to
   inertia. With the bottom stress related to the horizontal wind
   via standard bulk aerodynamic formula, the friction number is
   proportional to the surface roughness, the horizontal scale of
   the obstacle, and the inverse of the upstream fluid depth.
   Thus, under otherwise identical conditions, the flow past
   larger obstacles will be more ''viscous.'' Bottom friction
   modifies the vorticity generation in several ways, but under
   normal conditions, the wake formation remains dominated by a
   pseudoinviscid process related to the presence of hydraulic
   jumps. However, friction strongly controls the velocity-deficit
   region of the wake and thus influences the stability of the
   steady-state wakes. Predictions of the linear stability
   analysis are compared with numerical simulations of the eddy-
   shedding development under the stabilizing effect of friction.
   For the values of friction parameter for which linear theory
   predicts that the flow should be absolutely stable, fully
   nonlinear numerical evolutions indeed reach a stable quasi-
   stationary state. For a realistic value of bottom friction, the
   simulation of the flow past the island of Hawaii produces a
   wake that is consistent with the recent observations.

TI Near-surface structures in the Cape Ghir filament off Morocco
SO OCEANOLOGICA ACTA
AB A meso-scale CTD survey was conducted off Cape Ghir (31 degrees
   N) from 29 September to 3 October 1992, with the inspection of
   mass-field structures in the 300 dbar layer as its main
   objective, and relatively large tongue of cold surface water as
   the subject of investigation. This filament of upwelled water
   extends about 200 km seaward from the coastal zone of Morocco.
   Our CTD survey included two zonal transects 213 km in length,
   sampled synchronously by R/Vs Hudson along 31 degrees 30' N and
   A. v.Humboldt along 30 degrees 30' N. A meridional section
   followed the shelf edge at 10 degrees 10' W, and five zigzag
   sections were carried out above the Cape Ghir Plateau (CGP).
   Data resulting from an extended transect, sampled ten days
   earlier between 9 degrees 43' W and 14 degrees W at 32 degrees
   N, are also considered. Decadal means of available satellite IR
   data as well as bulk sea-surface temperatures (SST) indicate
   similar structures by a strict response of geostrophical motion
   patterns to irregularities in the bottom topography. The
   coastal jet bifurcates off the northern flank of the CGP. Its
   nearshore branch forms a cyclonic, eddy-like feature over the
   eastern part of the plateau. The related offshore branch feeds
   the filament with cold coastal water. The axis of that zonal
   filament follows the southern flank of the CGP at about 31
   degrees N. A simple balance of geostrophic net transports
   suggests that the mean upwelling velocity of the filament is of
   the same order within superficial layers as that of the coastal
   upwelling off Morocco. Two oppositely-rotating eddies interact
   to generate/maintain an intense seaward jet and to export cold
   upwelled water further out to sea, at least as far as 13
   degrees W.

TI Gravitational, symmetric, and baroclinic instability of the
   ocean mixed layer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB A hierarchy of hydrodynamical instabilities controlling the
   transfer of buoyancy through the oceanic mixed laver is
   reviewed. If a resting ocean of horizontally uniform
   stratification is subject to spatially uniform buoyancy loss at
   the sea surface, then gravitational instability ensues in which
   buoyancy is drawn from depth by upright convection. But if
   spatial inhomogeneities in the ambient stratification or the
   forcing are present (as always exist in nature), then
   horizontal density gradients will be induced and, within a
   rotation period, horizontal currents in thermal-wind balance
   with those gradients will be set up within the mixed layer.
   There are two important consequences on the convective process:
   1) Upright convection will become modified by the presence of
   the thermal wind sheer; fluid parcels are exchanged not along
   vertical paths but, rather, along slanting paths in symmetric
   instability. Theoretical considerations suggest that this
   slantwise convection sets the potential vorticity of the mixed
   layer fluid to zero but, in general, will leave it stably
   stratified in the vertical. 2) The convective process
   ultimately gives way to a baroclinic instability of the
   horizontal mixed layer density gradients. The resulting
   baroclinic waves are important agents of buoyancy transport
   through the mixed layer and can be so efficient that the
   convective process all but ceases. The authors illustrate and
   quantify these ideas by numerical experiment with a highly
   resolved nonhydrostatic Navier-Stokes model. Uniform spatial
   cooling at the surface of a resting, stratified fluid in a
   21/2-dimensional model on an f plane, in which zonal strips of
   fluid conserve their absolute momentum. causes energetic
   vertical overturning. A well-mixed boundary layer develops over
   a depth that is accurately predicted by a simple 1D law. In
   contrast, differential surface cooling induces a mixed layer
   front. Fluid parcels, made dense at the surface. sink along
   slanting trajectories in intense nonhydrostatic plumes. After
   cooling ceases the Ertel potential vorticity within the
   convective layer is indeed found to br vanishingly small,
   corresponding to convective neutrality measured in the absolute
   momentum surfaces that are tilted from the vertical by the
   horizontal vorticity of the thermal wind. In analogous fully
   three-dimensional calculations, the absolute momentum
   constraint is broken, and the convection at first coexists
   with, but is ultimately dominated by, a baroclinic instability
   of the mixed layer. For typical mixed layer depths of 500 m
   stability analysis predicts, and our explicit calculations
   confirm, that baroclinic waves with length scales O(5 km)
   develop with timescales of a day or so. By diagnosis of fully
   developed mixed layer turbulence, the authors assess the
   importance of the baroclinic eddy field as an agency of lateral
   and vertical buoyancy flux through the layer. A novel scaling
   for the lateral buoyancy flux due to the baroclinic eddies is
   suggested. These ideas are based on analysis of several
   experiments in which the initial stratification, rotation rate,
   and buoyancy forcing are varied, and the results are compared
   to previous attempts to parameterize the effects of baroclinic
   instability. There is a marked difference between the scaling
   that accounts for the resolved experiments and the Fickian
   schemes used traditionally in large-scale ocean models.
   Finally, consideration of the results in light of high-
   resolution mixed layer hydrographic surveys in the northeast
   Atlantic suggests mixed layer baroclinic instability may be
   very important at fronts. The authors speculate that the
   process exerts a large influence on the character of newly
   subducted thermocline water throughout the extratropical ocean.

TI The use of digital filter initialization to diagnose the
   mesoscale circulation and vertical motion in the California
   coastal transition zone
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB A dynamical method of initializing the primitive equations is
   tested and used to diagnose the three-dimensional circulation
   associated with jets and eddies as found in the California
   coastal transition zone (CTZ). The initialization method,
   referred to as digital filter initialization (DFI), was
   recently developed by [Monthly Weather Review 120 (1992) 1019]
   for use in an intermittent data assimilation system in the
   atmosphere. The ability of DFI to recover the mesoscale
   ageostrophic circulation associated with finite amplitude jets
   and eddies in the ocean is first demonstrated using control
   data produced by simulations with a primitive equation model.
   The DFI method is then applied to synoptic hydrographic data
   collected during several California CTZ surveys in the summer
   of 1988. The diagnostic results indicate the existence of jets,
   eddies, and filaments in the CTZ domain with maximum horizontal
   currents of the order of 0.6 m/s at the surface. Currents
   associated with such jets and filaments are coherent to a depth
   of over 500 m. The surface currents associated with a prominent
   cool filament are generally confluent, and weakly convergent on
   average, along the 270 km offshore extent of the filament.
   Meanders in the jet display convergence and downwelling
   upstream of pressure troughs and divergence and upwelling
   downstream of the troughs. Maximum vertical velocities at 100 m
   are of the order of 10 m/day. This result is consistent with
   independent estimates of subduction rates made from biological
   studies in this and similar coastal filaments in the CTZ
   program. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Characteristic patterns of the circulation in the Santa Barbara
   Channel
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB The subtidal near-surface circulation in the Santa Barbara
   Channel (SEC) and on the shelf north of Point Conception is
   described based on observations obtained during the 3-year
   period from 1993 to 1995. Near-surface currents in the channel
   are a superposition of a larger-than-SBC scale flow and a
   cyclonic circulation of variable intensity located inside the
   channel. On seasonal timescales the larger-than-SEC scale flow
   near the surface is equatorward in spring and poleward from
   summer through winter. The increase in equatorward flow in
   spring occurs concurrently with the increase in equatorward
   wind stress and the decrease in near-surface temperatures and
   synthetic subsurface pressures (SSPs). The flow reverses in
   late spring, simultaneously with the increase in the along-
   channel SSP difference and months before wind stress has
   reached its peak. The period during which the cyclonic
   circulation within the SEC is strongest coincides with the
   period of strongest poleward flow through the eastern entrance.
   A synoptic description of the circulation in the SEC is
   presented in terms of six characteristic patterns, labeled
   Upwelling, Relaxation, Cyclonic, Propagating Cyclones, Flood
   East, and Flood West. An analysis of the 5- and 45-m currents
   into empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) isolates 50% (53%)
   of the 5-m (45-m) low-frequency current variance into three
   (two) modes. Combining these modes with the mean current
   fields, the modes have spatial patterns that correspond to the
   characteristic flow patterns subjectively deduced from
   inspection of daily averages of the near-surface currents. From
   late spring through fall the two largest 5-m current modes
   produce a repeating pattern of circulation in which the
   sequence of four states (namely, Upwelling, Cyclonic,
   Relaxation, and Quiescent) is traversed roughly every 16 days.
   In addition to the large-scale cyclonicity in the central SEC,
   smaller cyclonic eddies form frequently in the eastern channel
   and travel toward the west with an average speed of 0.06 m s(-
   1). The patterns described here develop in response to the wind
   stress and the along-channel SSP gradient.

TI Spatial and temporal distributions of copepods to leeward and
   windward of Oahu, Hawaiian Archipelago
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
AB The spatial and temporal distributions of two island-associated
   copepod species, Undinula vulgaris Dana and Labidocera madurae
   Scott, were compared to the distributions of two open ocean
   species, Cosmocalanus darwinii Lubbock and Scolecithrix danae
   Lubbock, along 28-km windward and leeward transects off the
   island of Oahu, Hawaii. Samples were taken in September and
   December 1985 and April and June 1986. A warm, low salinity
   pool on the leeward side was a prominent feature during all
   transects except December. The abundances of the two oceanic
   species did not change significantly between leeward and
   windward stations, with distance from shore, or between
   September 1985 and April 1986 samples. As expected, very high
   abundances of U. vulgaris occurred at some nearshore stations,
   up to 3 g dry wt m(-2) for adults alone. Calculations of
   respiratory loss at these densities (0.7 g C m(-2) d(-1))
   suggest a high local productivity would be required to meet
   these demands. L. madurae, a surface-dwelling species normally
   restricted to within 1 km of shore, was an effective indicator
   species of nearshore water movement. It was more common in
   offshore samples on the leeward transects, rarely being found
   offshore on the windward side, consistent with prevailing
   currents and the presence of the leeward warm, low salinity
   pool. The occurrence of a strong mixing event in April 1986
   resulted in L. madurae being distributed throughout the upper
   100 m of the water column. The presence of oceanic species
   close to shore on the windward side also coincided with this
   wind-driven event. The primary environmental influence on
   vertical distributions was daytime cloud cover, with U.
   vulgaris tending to be found shallower on cloudy days. Of the
   two oceanic species, S. danae exhibited the most pronounced
   vertical migration,however, vertical distributions were not
   significantly correlated with environmental factors for either
   species. The abundant nearshore U. vulgaris population cannot
   be explained by differences in vertical distribution between it
   and the two oceanic species that might allow a physical
   mechanism to concentrate U. vulgaris. A high population growth
   rate is likely necessary to explain U. vulgaris' dominance.

TI PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF A COASTAL EDDY
   NEAR CAPE MENDOCINO
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH
AB We sampled mesoscale physical, chemical and biological
   structure in the coastal region of northern California in May,
   1987.  The circulation was dominated by an equatorward-flowing
   coastal jet and by a set of mesoscale eddies.  High-velocity
   flow in the core of the coastal jet was composed of low-
   salinity, low-nutrient water.  Cyclonic coastal eddies were
   observed near Cape Mendocino and Pt. Arena.  The Cape Mendocino
   eddy is examined in detail.  This eddy is a common feature
   which was present both before and after the spring transition,
   suggesting a relatively weak coupling between the eddy and the
   local wind field. The coastal circulation strongly affected the
   chemical and biological structure of the region.  The coastal
   jet and cyclonic eddy increased primary production and
   phytoplankton biomass by increasing the nutrient supply to the
   euphotic zone.  The change in slope of density surfaces in
   association with high-velocity flow in the jet and eddy raised
   isopycnals carrying nutrients to the surface layer.  The
   inshore edge of the coastal jet marked the boundary between
   rich coastal water and oligotrophic offshore water.  Since the
   jet was not carrying nutrients in the surface layer, advection
   by this feature was not an important nutrient source for the
   coastal ocean.  The cyclonic flow and secondary circulation
   associated with the eddy appeared to act as a nutrient pump
   which provided a continuing input of high nutrient, low
   chlorophyll water to the center of the eddy.  This resulted in
   low chlorophyll in the eddy center, and high chlorophyll and a
   large excess in dissolved oxygen at its outer edge.  The
   coupling between physical and biological structure in the study
   region differs from that described for systems dominated by
   wind-driven coastal upwelling.

TI Mesoscale forcing of a boundary layer jet along the California
   coast
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB Mesoscale numerical model simulations were examined to
   investigate the thermal and topographic forcing of a boundary
   layer jet along the northern California coast from 0000 UTC May
   2 to 1200 UTC May 3, 1990. Routine surface and upper air
   observations, satellite, and higher-resolution coastal
   observations (R/V Point Sur and Doppler wind profiler data)
   documented the diurnal evolution of a coastal marine
   atmospheric boundary layer (MABL), coastal cloud structure, and
   mesoscale features such as the coastal jet and land-sea breeze
   circulations that were reasonably well forecast by the
   numerical model. Sensitivity model simulations to coastal
   baroclinicity showed that the diurnal development and
   intensification of the coastal MABL jet located north of the
   San Francisco Bay area was a result of thermal forcing due to
   differential land-sea heating. Simulations in which the coastal
   baroclinicity was held fixed in time at a minimal strength
   showed no diurnal development of the MABL jet. The strength of
   the jet was approximated well by the thermal wind relationship,
   with the jet core located in the sloping marine inversion layer
   within one Rossby radius of deformation from the coastline. The
   steepness of the marine inversion at the coastline was enhanced
   by regions of strong MABL divergence just offshore and strong
   convergence onshore resulting from the sea breeze circulation.
   Modifications to coastal terrain in two separate sensitivity
   model simulations illustrated that the primary effect of
   coastal topography was to act as a barrier to the onshore
   intrusion of higher momentum offshore air. This blocking was
   due to a topographically forced vertical circulation with a
   strong descending branch located at the coast. This downslope
   flow and adiabatic warming steepened the MABL inversion at the
   coast and enhanced the coastal baroclinicity and the coastal
   jet. Simulations without coastal terrain showed a jet structure
   that was spatially diffuse across the coastline and displaced
   more shoreward. Simulations in which coastal valleys were
   removed and replaced by a larger coastal mountain range
   resulted in little modification to the coastal jet intensity or
   offshore displacement.

TI Upper-ocean water mass characteristics of the California
   current, Summer 1993
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Two large, high-resolution upper-ocean surveys of the
   California Current region were conducted in the summer of 1993.
   Temperature and salinity were measured from a Seasoar vehicle,
   and velocity was measured by a ship-borne acoustic Doppler
   current profiler. Both surveys extended from the continental
   margin to 128 degrees W, and consisted of zonal sections 28 km
   apart. The first survey (7-28 June) extended from 39.5 degrees
   N to 36.25 degrees N, and the second (16 August to 1 September)
   extended from 39.0 degrees N to 37.0 degrees N. The current
   held was fairly simple in June, showing an equatorward surface
   jet with only one gentle meander, a nearly continuous poleward
   California Undercurrent near the continental margin, and two
   anticyclonic subsurface eddies offshore of the jet. By August
   meanders in the surface jet had strengthened, and eddies
   dominated the flow held. Large-scale trends in the water-mass
   characteristics ("spiciness") along three isopycnal surfaces
   (26.4, 26.0 and 25.6 kg m(-3)) show that temperature and
   salinity tend to increase towards the equator and towards
   shore, consistent with poleward advection along the continental
   margin. Local minima in spiciness tend to coincide with the
   equatorward surface jet. Local maxima in spiciness are
   associated with subsurface anticyclonic eddies which have a
   core depth of about 150 m, and seem to originate in the
   California Undercurrent over the continental slope at local
   latitudes. We identified several different anticyclonic eddies,
   each with different water-mass characteristics; all of the
   eddies we observed had diameters larger than the baroclinic
   radius of deformation. Watermass characteristics and migration
   rates are consistent with formation over the continental margin
   within the preceding 6-8 months. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI CURRENTS AND WATER MASSES OF THE COASTAL TRANSITION ZONE OFF
   NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, JUNE TO AUGUST 1988
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB In summer 1988, we made repeated mesoscale surveys of a grid
   extending 200 km offshore between 37-degrees-N and 39-degrees-N
   in the coastal transition zone off northern California,
   obtaining continuous acoustic Doppler current profiler data and
   conductivity-temperature-depth data at standard stations 25 km
   apart on alongshore sections 40 km apart.  All surveys showed a
   baroclinic equatorward jet, with core velocities of > 50 cm s-1
   at the surface decreasing to about 10 cm s-1 at 200 m, a width
   of 50-75 km, and a baroclinic transport of about 4 Sv.  The
   core of the jet lay between the 8.6 and 9.4 m2 s-2 contours of
   geopotential anomaly (relative to 500 dbar).  Three current
   meter moorings, deployed at 25-km separation across the jet at
   the beginning of the survey sequence, provided time-series of
   the velocity; throughout the 37-day deployment, at least one
   mooring was within the core defined by the 8.6 and 9.4 m2 s-2
   contours.  The jet flowed southwestward across the grid from
   late June until mid-July 1988, when the jet axis moved offshore
   in the north and onshore in the southern portion of the grid.
   Temperature-salinity analysis shows that jet waters can be
   distinguished from both the freshly upwelled coastal waters and
   the offshore waters.  Isopycnal maps indicate alongshore
   advection of relatively fresh, cool water from farther north,
   as well as small-scale patchiness not resolved by our survey
   grid.  The baroclinic jet observed here may be continuous with
   the core of the California Current off central California.  The
   later surveys clearly showed a poleward-flowing undercurrent
   adjacent to the continental slope, with core velocities up to
   20 cm s-1 at depths of 150-250 m.  Its baroclinic transport
   (relative to 500 dbar) increased from < 0.5 Sv to > 1.0 Sv
   between late June and early August 1988.  Within the survey
   grid, there was a definite onshore gradient in the
   characteristics of North Pacific Intermediate Water.  The
   subsurface waters adjacent to the continental margin were
   warmer and more saline than those offshore, indicating net
   northward advection by the California Undercurrent over the
   inshore 100 km and equatorward advection farther from shore.

TI THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN COASTAL WATERS AND
   THE OPEN OCEAN OFF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, WINTER AND SPRING 1987
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Physical and biological fields in the coastal transition zone
   off northern California were measured during February, March,
   May and June 1987 in an extended alongshore region between 60
   km and 150 km offshore.  The spring transition, as seen in
   coastal sea level and winds, occurred in mid-March.  Surface
   variability during the two spring cruises was stronger and of
   larger scale than that seen during the two winter cruises.  An
   equatorward-tending current, flowing along the boundary between
   low steric sea level inshore and high steric sea level
   offshore, dominated both the directly-measured (acoustic
   Doppler current profiler) and geostrophic current fields during
   spring.  Current jets of comparable strength directed both
   offshore and onshore were seen off Cape Mendocino and Point
   Arena; these evolved significantly in the 3 weeks between
   cruises.  Inshore of the current, properties associated with
   upwelled water were found near the surface, including low
   temperature and high salinity, nutrients and chlorophyll;
   offshore of the current, waters were warmer, less saline, lower
   in nutrients and more oligotrophic.  Geostrophic and directly
   measured volume transports in the current were about 2-3 Sv.
   Isopycnals inshore of the spring upwelling front were displaced
   vertically by O(40-80 m) from their depths during the winter
   survey; these displacements extended deep into the water column
   and were largely independent of depth between 100 and 400 m.
   Surface mixed layers tended to be deep in winter and shallower
   inshore of the upwelling front in spring.  A connection between
   the equatorward-tending frontal jet off northern California and
   the more well-studied California Current further south is
   suggested by the similarity of their transports and of their
   dynamic height values.

TI SUBTIDAL CIRCULATION OVER THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SHELF
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB The circulation over the shelf and upper slope off northern
   California, between 38-degrees-N and 42-degrees-N, was observed
   using moored current and temperature recorders deployed as part
   of the Northern California Coastal Circulation Study (NCCCS),
   from March 1987 through October 1989. The results of this study
   provide a larger-scale view of the wind-driven circulation than
   that described through the 1981-1982 Coastal Ocean Dynamics
   Experiment (CODE), particularly with regard to alongshore and
   temporal variations. From an improved description of the
   frequency structure of wind and current, a very low frequency
   (VLF) signal is identified in the observed currents at
   frequencies below those typical of wind forcing. The majority
   of this VLF variance appears to be accounted for by persistent
   flow events associated with the presence of mesoscale
   circulation in the adjacent ocean. The longer duration of the
   NCCCS also allows an improved description of the seasonality of
   flow regimes off northern California. Three oceanic seasons are
   identified: an upwelling season (April-July), a relaxation
   season (August-November), and a storm season (December-March).
   Alongshore variations in the strength of upwelling, in the
   strength of the alongshore flow, both near-surface arid
   undercurrent, and in water temperature not only are a function
   of latitude, as is the wind, but they also correspond to
   location relative to promontories, notably Cape Mendocino.
   Immediately south of Cape Mendocino, the near-surface flow
   exhibits an equatorward minimum and a temperature minimum,
   whereas the undercurrent exhibits a poleward maximum.
   Conversely, at the moorings immediately north of the cape,
   temperatures are a maximum and the undercurrent exhibits a
   minimum. The maximum in near-surface temperature relates to a
   minimum in upwelling; no significant correlation was found
   between local wind and current immediately north of Cape
   Mendocino. This upwelling minimum and the upwelling maximum
   south of the cape were also observed as persistent sea surface
   temperature patterns in satellite imagery.

TI A dynamical description of fall and winter mean current
   profiles over the northern California shelf
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Fall and winter mean current profiles from a midshelf (water
   depth similar to 90 m) northern California site exhibit a
   similar vertical structure for several different years. The
   alongshelf flow is poleward with a maximum velocity of 5-10 cm
   s(-1) in the middle or upper water column. There is an offshore
   flow of about 2 cm s(-1) in the upper 20-30 m, an onshore flow
   of about 2 cm s(-1) in the interior (depths 35-65 m), and an
   offshore flow of about 1 cm s(-1) within 20 m of the bottom.
   Profiles are similar for averages over timescales from weeks to
   months. Mean current profiles at other midshelf sites along
   northern California and two sites off Peru also have a similar
   vertical structure. The vertical shear in the mean alongshelf
   flow is geostrophic throughout the water column, that is, in
   thermal wind balance with the cross-shelf density gradient. For
   timescales of a week or longer the thermal wind balance extends
   to within 1 m of the bottom and reduces the mean near-bottom
   alongshelf flow to 1 cm s(-1) or less. These observations
   support recent theoretical work suggesting that, over a sloping
   bottom, adjustment of the flow and density fields within the
   bottom boundary layer may reduce the bottom stress. The
   alongshelf momentum balance is less clear. Weekly averages of
   offshore transports in the upper and lower water column,
   relative to the interior onshore flow, are correlated with the
   surface and bottom stresses, suggesting Ekman balances.
   However, both the surface and bottom stresses are generally too
   small by a factor of 2-3 to account for the offshore
   transports. Limited data suggest that alongshelf buoyancy
   gradients, estimated over scales of 15 km or less, can be a
   significant component of the alongshelf momentum balance within
   both the upper and lower water column.

TI PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMICS IN A COASTAL JET FRONTAL REGION
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-PROGRESS SERIES
AB We studied the physiological status and turbulent transport of
   phytoplankton across the quasi-permanent 150 km long estuarine
   front separating the Gaspe current from the Anticosti gyre (NW
   Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada). In early June, chl a
   concentrations reached 35 mug l-1 in the current, but remained
   < 1 mug l-1 in the gyre. At that time of maximum river runoff
   and horizontal shear stress, the phytoplankton biomass
   developing in the current was rapidly transported across the
   front by turbulent mixing. The strong correlation between chl a
   and salinity (r = -0.96) indicated that the rate of cross-
   frontal dilution far exceeded the rate of phytoplankton
   production. The N:C and C:chl a ratios increased and decreased,
   respectively, with cross-frontal mixing as nutrient-deficient
   cells from the Gaspe current experienced higher nutrient
   concentrations and a deepening of the mixed layer in the front.
   As freshwater runoff and frontal mixing decreased in summer,
   phytoplankton biomass accumulated in the density front and at
   the base of the jet current, where low advection and sufficient
   light and nutrient conditions prevailed. Sporadic upwelling
   along the front contributed an estimated 5 and 9 % of the total
   seaward flux of nitrate and silicate, respectively. Thus,
   nutrients from the drainage basin of the St. Lawrence, rather
   than the frontal upwelling of deep water, would be responsible
   for the bulk of the inorganic nutrient flux from the NW Gulf of
   St. Lawrence to the southern Gulf and the Scotian Shelf.

TI West Florida shelf response to upwelling favorable wind
   forcing: Kinematics
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB The barotropic responses of the west Florida continental shelf
   to idealized upwelling favorable alongshore and offshore wind
   stresses are studied using the three-dimensional, time-
   dependent, primitive equation Princeton Ocean Model (POM). When
   forced with uniform winds, the shelf circulation evolves
   quickly to a quasi steady state. A southeastward alongshore
   wind lowers sea level along the coast and drives a
   southeastward coastal jet with a relatively weak northwestward
   return flow farther offshore. A southwestward offshore wind
   lowers sea level along the west Florida coast and raises sea
   level along the Panhandle coast. Two independent circulation
   gyres are set up in association with these regionally different
   sea level distributions: an anticyclonic gyre off the west
   Florida coast consisting of a southeastward coastal jet and a
   broad return flow over the middle shelf and a cyclonic gyre off
   the Panhandle coast consisting of a strong northwestward
   coastal jet and an adjacent narrow southeastward undercurrent.
   These gyres are separated by the Big Bend region. In both cases
   (alongshore and offshore wind forcing) the circulations are
   fully three-dimensional, with opposing surface and bottom
   boundary layer flows accounting for the across-shelf
   transports. The shapes of the coastline and the isobaths are
   important determinants of the shelf-wide responses. Several
   locally maximum upwelling regions are identified for
   geometrical reasons. These include the Panhandle coast south of
   Apalachicola Bay, the west Florida coast south of Tampa Bay,
   along the Florida Keys, and at the shelf break where
   topographic Rossby waves are evident.

TI On the structure of a Taylor column driven by a buoyant parcel
   in an unbounded rotating fluid
SO JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
AB The velocity and pressure fields produced in a homogeneous
   rapidly rotating fluid driven by an isolated buoyant parcel are
   investigated. Gravity and rotation are allowed to have
   arbitrary orientations and the parcel shape is assumed
   Gaussian. Inertial forces and time-dependent effects are
   ignored. The linear problem is easily solved by three-
   dimensional Fourier transform, and the inversion is facilitated
   by assuming the Ekman number, E, to be very small. In this
   limit the fields form a Taylor column extended in the direction
   of the rotation axis. In the absence of rigid boundaries no
   boundary layers occur. The velocity and pressure in the
   vicinity of the parcel are found in closed form while elsewhere
   (within the Taylor column) they are expressed in terms of
   relatively simple scalar integrals which are easily evaluated.
   Within the buoyant parcel, the momentum balance is baroclinic,
   involving Coriolis, pressure and buoyancy forces. Outside the
   parcel, the balance is geostrophic at unit order. The viscous
   force is important at order E and determines the axial
   structure of the Taylor column. In contrast to the case of how
   driven by a rigid body, no 'Taylor slug' of recirculating flow
   occurs. The velocity and pressure decay algebraically with
   distance from the parcel, with the scale of variation being a/E
   in the axial direction and a in the radial direction, where a
   is the parcel radius. In the vicinity of the parcel, the return
   flow occurs in a broad region surrounding the parcel. The
   structure of flow in the vicinity of the parcel is independent
   of the Ekman number. This return flow sweeps the fringes of the
   parcel backward, making the net rise speed significantly slower
   than that of a rigid sphere of identical buoyancy. The return
   flow also acts to deform the parcel; this deformation is
   quantified.

TI ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH A CALIFORNIA
   CURRENT COLD FILAMENT
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB In July 1988 we sampled upper layer zooplankton distributions
   in and around a major cold filament located off Point Arena,
   California.  Average zooplankton biomass levels declined
   inshore to offshore, but relatively high levels extended
   seaward along the cool side of the filament jet.  A series of
   transverse station lines shows strong shifts in community
   composition across the axis of the filament.  The cross-
   filament compositional sequence was recognizably similar along
   each line, giving an impression (supported by cluster analysis
   and along-flow versus cross-flow spatial autocorrelation) of
   banding parallel to the filament axis.  The "standard" sequence
   was characterized by local maxima of Dolioletta gegenbauri in
   nonfilament waters to the south and east, Euphausia pacifica
   along the southeast margin of the filament, Eucalanus
   californicus and euphausiid larvae within the cool core of the
   filament and extending partway across the strong seaward jet on
   the north and west margin of the filament, and heteropod
   larvae, chaetognaths, Dolioletta, and a mixture of small
   copepods (including several with southern and offshore faunal
   affinities) along the warm side of the jet and extending into
   nonfilament waters to the north and west.  A "core" group of
   samples characterized by high abundance of Eucalanus matched
   the trajectories of drifters released at the upstream end of
   the filament.  Both crossed geopotential anomaly contours (to
   larger phi) as they moved out the filament, suggesting a cross-
   jet component of motion.

TI OCEANIC CIRCULATION AND TURBULENCE IN THE COASTAL ZONE
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB Measurements of turbulent eddy viscosities within 1 km of Bass
   Point (a 4 km wide headland near Sydney, Australia) indicate
   the presence of a relatively high level of turbulent energy,
   apparently caused by the complex subsurface topography near the
   point. This energy has typical length scale approximately 300
   m, typical time scale approximately 100 min and an eddy
   viscosity of approximately 15 m2 s-1, one to two orders of
   magnitude greater than that due to mixed layer turbulence
   alone. Despite the fact that the headland protrudes well out
   onto the continental shelf where strong longshore
   (approximately 0.2-0.5 m s-1) currents often exist, large-scale
   recirculation in the lee of the headland is rarely observed.
   The turbulence near the tip of the point prevents the formation
   of a single narrow shear layer (caused by separation at the
   point), and instead provides a much wider turbulent shear layer
   where the non-linear terms are apparently ineffective at
   driving a large-scale recirculation. The overall effect appears
   to be analogous to a ''trip wire'' or ''vortex generator''
   whereby the enhanced generation of turbulence acts to alter the
   overall pressure field and pushes the separation point far
   downstream (or eliminates it entirely). The result is that the
   large scale flow appears often to be almost laminar, and
   somewhat analogous to that which is expected from a truly low
   Reynolds number flow.

AB Recent turbulence measurements over a small bank on the

   site for intense mixing of the coastal ocean. The flow is
   hydraulically controlled and turbulence diffusivities over the
   bank are more than 100 times greater than estimates made on the
   shelf away from topography. The total drag exerted by the bank
   on the flow field is a combination of bottom friction plus form
   drag (analogous to mountain drag) and is comparable to the
   Coriolis force. This drag is sufficient to decelerate the flow
   over the bank in a matter of hours.

TI Detiding three-dimensional velocity survey data in coastal
   waters
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
AB A three-dimensional data interpolation technique is proposed
   that efficiently removes tidal currents from spatial velocity
   surveys. The least squares method extends prior two-dimensional
   deriding methods to three spatial dimensions using biharmonic
   splines. Biharmonic splines are fitted to velocity data from
   acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) surveys, moorings, and
   ocean surface current radar (OSCR). The data are used to
   predict diurnal and semidiurnal tidal currents on the inner
   shelf off New Jersey that vary between 1 and 15 cm s(-1) at
   spatial scales of about 20 km. The (tidal) signal to (subtidal)
   noise is thus O(1) in the study area. Although the main task of
   this study is to remove tidal variance from the ADCP survey
   data, an attempt is made to accurately "predict" tidal currents
   from the data. The latter task is more difficult. Both
   artificial data with known signal-to-noise properties and
   actual measurements indicate that the method estimates bath
   diurnal and semidiurnal tidal currents to within about 3.5 cm
   s(-1) rms, or 30% of the true tidal signals. While the
   biharmonic splines remove tidal currents successfully, the
   prediction of the vertical structure of tidal currents is only
   fair. Some experimentation guided by physical intuition and
   prior knowledge of the tidal fields is necessary in order to
   obtain an accurate and stable solution. While this ambiguity
   constitutes the main disadvantage of the method, its simple
   algebraic expression to predict tidal currents in space and
   time is its main advantage. Properly weighting velocity data
   from different sources, such as moorings, surface current
   radar, and ADCP surveys of different quality, improves the
   quality of the fit.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE-SUID-AFRIKAANSE

AB Recent work in the Canary Current upwelling system highlights
   the role of previously uninvestigated filament structures. A
   filament located near 27 degreesN in summer 1993 extended 150
   km offshore with a width of similar to 20 km and surface
   temperature anomaly up to 2 degreesC. The cool temperature
   signal was restricted to a shallow surface layer, and the
   filament was entrained around a large cyclonic eddy. Offshore
   transport in the filament, in excess of 1 Sv, may be a major
   influence in dispersal of material originating in the region of
   active coastal upwelling. The location of the filament studied
   appears repeatable From year to year, suggestive of a strong
   relation with the topographically trapped eddy, which was
   situated downstream of a lateral ridge between the Canary
   islands and the African coast.

TI Subtidal currents over the central California slope: evidence
   for offshore veering of the undercurrent and for direct, wind-
   driven slope currents
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB In February 1991, an array of six current meter moorings was
   deployed for one year across the central California outer shelf
   and slope. The main line of the array extended 30 km offshore
   of the shelf break, out to water depths of 1400 m. A more
   sparsely-instrumented line, displaced 30 km to the northwest,
   extended 14 km offshore. Though shorter, the northern line
   spanned similar water depths because the gradient of the
   topography steepened in the northern region. A poleward flow
   pattern, typical of the California undercurrent, was seen
   across both lines in the array over most of the year. The
   poleward flow was surface intensified. In general, the portion
   of the undercurrent that crossed the southern line had larger
   amplitudes and penetrated more deeply into the water column
   than the portion that crossed the northern line. Transport over
   the year ranged from 0 to 2.5 Sverdrups (Sv) poleward across
   the southern line; 0 to 1 Sv poleward across the northern line.
   We suggest the difference in transport was caused by
   topographic constraints, which tended to force the poleward
   flow offshore of the northern measurement sites. The slope of
   the topography steepened too abruptly to allow the poleward
   flow to follow isobaths when currents were strong. When current
   velocities lessened, a more coherent flow pattern was seen
   across both lines in the array. In general, the poleward flow
   patterns in the undercurrent were not affected by local winds
   or by the local alongshore pressure gradient. Nor was a strong
   seasonal pattern evident. Rather unexpectedly, a small but
   statistically significant fraction of the current variance over
   the mid- and outer slope was driven by the surface wind stress.
   An alongshelf wind stress caused cut-rents to flow along the
   slope, parallel to the wind field, down to depths of 400 m
   below the surface and out to distances of 2 Rossby radii past
   the shelf break. The transfer functions were weak, 3-4 cm/s per
   dyn cm(-2) but comparable to wind-driven current amplitudes of
   4-6 cm/s per unit wind stress over the middle shelf.
   Equatorward, alongshelf winds also caused water from 200-300 m
   over the slope to upwell onto the shelf as the surface water
   moved offshore. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

TI OBSERVATIONS AND SCALE ANALYSIS OF COASTAL WIND JETS
SO MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
AB Blocking of onshore flow by coastal mountains was observed
   south of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, by the NOAA P-3
   aircraft on 1 December 1993. Winds increased from 10 m s(-1)
   offshore to 15 m s(-1) nearshore and became more parallel to
   shore in the blocked region, which had a vertical scale of 500
   m and an offshore scale of 40-50 km. These length scale and
   velocity increases are comparable to theory. The flow was
   semigeostrophic with the coast being hydrodynamically steep;
   that is, the coast acts like a wall and the alongshore momentum
   balance is ageostrophic. This is shown by the nondimensional
   slope parameter-the Burger number, B = h(m)N/fL(m)-being
   greater than 1, where h(m) and L(m) are the height and half-
   width of the mountain, N is the stability frequency, and fis
   the Coriolis parameter. The height scale is given by setting
   the local Froude number equal to 1-that is, h(l) = U/N similar
   to 500 m, where U is the onshore component of velocity. This
   scale is appropriate when h(l) is less than the mountain
   height, h(m); in this case h(l)/h(m) similar to 0.4. The
   offshore scale is given by the Rossby radius L(R) = (Nh(m)/f)
   F-m = U/f similar to 50 km for F-m < 1, where the mountain
   Froude number F-m = h(l)/h(m) = U/h(m)N similar to 0.4. The
   increase in the alongshore wind speed due to blocking. Delta V,
   is equal to the onshore component of the Row, U approximate to
   6 m s(-1) or in this case about half of the near-coastal
   alongshore component. A second case on 11 December 1993 had
   stronger onshore winds and weak stratification and was in a
   different hydrodynamic regime, with F-m similar to 6. When F-m
   > l, L(R) = Nh(m)/f similar to 200 km, and Delta V = h(m)N
   similar to 2 m s(-1), a small effect comparable to changes in
   the synoptic-scale flow. The authors expect a maximum coastal
   jet response when F-m similar to 1.

TI ON THE ROLE OF SHEAR MIXING DURING TRANSIENT COASTAL UPWELLING
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB A two-dimensional two-layer model for wind-driven transient
   coastal upwelling is formulated. The momentum equations include
   the turbulent dynamics and the time-dependent and nonlinear
   terms in both the cross- and along-shore directions. The
   continuity and heat equations allow mass and heat turbulent
   transfer between both layers. The integral form of the
   momentum, continuity and heat equations are closed using a two-
   regime parameterization for the entrainment velocity. In the
   first regime, corresponding to the early stages of upwelling,
   the interface quickly raises due to Bur divergence near the
   coast. The entrainment velocity is small (0.1-1 m day(-1)),
   largely produced through KRAUS and TURNER'S [(1967) Tellus, 19,
   98-106] slow erosion of the thermocline. and it is estimated
   using NILLER and KRAUS' [(1977) In: Modelling and prediction of
   the upper layers of the ocean, Pergamon Press, Oxford, pp.143-
   172] parameterization. When the bulk Richardson number (Ri)
   becomes close to its critical value then we switch to the
   second regime, during which we calculate the entrainment
   velocity from the continuity equation under the condition that
   Ri remains near-critical, i.e. the equivalent of POLLARD et al.
   [(1973) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, 4, 381-404] stability
   criterion for the upper ocean. The entrainment velocity quickly
   becomes large (several m h-l), the interface deepens and
   stratification is eroded. The existence of this regime is
   supported by observations of persistent near-critical gradient
   Richardson numbers (Ri(g)) during coastal upwelling [JOHNSON
   (1981) In: Coastal upwelling, American Geophysical Union,
   Washington, DC., pp. 79-86; JOHNSON et al. (1976) Journal of
   Physical Oceanography, 6, 556-574; KUNDU and BEARDSLEY, (1991)
   Journal of Geophysical Research, 96, 4855-4868]. Our model is
   applied to several initial temperature differences between the
   surface and bottom layers, with the upper layer depth and
   forcing parameters realistically chosen. The dynamically
   important mixing regime corresponds to the second regime, with
   effective shear-induced mixing being produced through a strong
   baroclinic coastal jet. A realistic front, formed between the
   well-mixed water near the coast and lighter offshore surface
   water, propagates away from the coast. The offshore waters are
   characterized by the presence of inertial oscillations,
   overlying the Ekman flow. The inertial oscillations are too
   weak to produce any significant mixing, but a comparison with
   DESZOEKE and RICHMAN'S [(1984) Journal of Physical
   Oceanagraphy, 14, 364-377] semigeostrophic model (modified to
   include the shear-mixing regime) shows that they are important
   enough to exert some control on the horizontal volume flux
   divergence near the coast. A relatively fast internal Poincare
   wave, propagating from the coast, has the effect of slowly
   dampening the inertial oscillations. The results are in good
   qualitative agreement with early observations by JOHNSON et al.
   (1976).

   remained warm but freshened in fall (S = 33.3-33.4), and cooled
   and freshened further in winter ( similar to 13 degrees C, S =
   32.9-33.3). Nitrate time series show high concentrations (10-20
   mu M) present at the surface during spring and summer; low
   concentrations (< 1 mu M) occurred sporadically during fall and
   winter. High primary production values ( > 100 mg C m(-3) da(-
   1)) occurred in upper 20 m of the water column, while high
   chlorophyll ( > 3 mg m(-3)) extended to 25-30 m. Phytoplankton
   blooms occurred as pulses of primary production and chlorophyll
   during spring, summer and occasionally in fall. Springtime
   spatial data show a surface 'plume' of cold, salty, low
   chlorophyll and low primary production water extending N-S
   across the mouth of the Monterey Bay. The time-series station
   H3/M1 lies in the path of this plume. High chlorophyll and
   productivity values occur on the margins of the plume. Fall
   spatial data show temperatures and salinities warmer and
   fresher than spring while chlorophyll and primary production
   values were low. There was less spatial variability in fall. A
   temperature/salinity time series for Monterey Bay from 1951 to
   1991 (Kuo, 1991) shows similar seasonal patterns. However, the
   1989-1996 time series is warmer and fresher to at least 100 m,
   particularly during non-upwelling seasons, and shows a later
   onset of upwelling. These differences are in accord with the
   'regime shift' associated changes documented for the California
   Current by other workers. Long-term climatologies for nitrate,
   chlorophyll and primary production are not available for
   comparison with thr data presented in this paper. (C) 2000

TI Simulation of a coastal jet retention process using a
   barotropic model
SO OCEANOLOGICA ACTA
AB In the southern Benguela, sardine and anchovy spawn on the
   Western Agulhas Bank. Eggs and larvae are transported to the
   West coast nursery ground by a! coastal current. Once the
   larvae reach the West coast, retention within the favorable
   coastal domain is key to larvae survival and recruitment. The
   Cape Columbine-St Helena Bay area is the main nursery ground
   along the West Coast. In this area, the interaction between
   upwelling and topography results in the formation of an
   upwelling plume. The plume, and the associated circulation
   patterns, is thought to be the mechanism providing retention
   within the coastal domain. The dynamics of the plume are
   studied using a set of:numerical experiments. It is shown that
   an equatorward wind forcing produces a cyclonic eddy in the lee
   of Cape Columbine. A balance between advection and bottom
   friction regulates the evolution of this eddy. The eddy
   contributes to create a dynamic boundary between the coastal
   and the offshore domains. Retention induced by the eddy is
   quantified using a tracer. The magnitude of retention is
   positively related to the wind for weak to moderate wind
   intensities. For strong wind intensity, retention reaches a
   maximum or slightly decreases. This is in agreement with
   previous results relating recruitment success with wind speed.

TI Spatial organization of particle size composition in an eddy-
   jet system off California
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB We describe here the results of an interdisciplinary study
   conducted off the coast of northern and central California
   during September 1993 in which we deployed an Optical Plankton
   Counter. This instrument counted and measured particles in the
   size range between 0.27 and 9.8 mm equivalent spheric diameter
   (ESD) occurring between the surface and 240 m depth. The survey
   region was characterized by the presence of the California
   Current jet and a cyclonic and an anticyclonic eddy. We
   analyzed the spatial (horizontal and vertical) distribution of
   planktonic particles and their relation to this hydrodynamic
   structure. We used specific analytical methods that take into
   account spatial constraints, i.e. autocorrelation analysis,
   constrained agglomerative clustering and contiguity constraints
   permutation analysis of variance. Horizontal spatial
   organization of particles was revealed at three different
   spatial scales (5, 18 and 100 km), while vertical patterns were
   described at a much smaller scale (20 m). We could detect some
   degree of similarity between particle size category spatial
   organization and hydrodynamic structure both by size category
   association independent of current movements and by comparison
   of dynamically differentiated areas. Five groups of similar
   size composition were detected that had some relation to the
   dynamic structure. Four sub-regions were determined a priori by
   their different hydrodynamic heights. We could describe a
   variability of particle abundance among these regions, both for
   total particles and for some size categories. Particles were
   more abundant inside the cyclonic eddy and less abundant inside
   the anticyclonic eddy. We also found deep concentration maxima
   inside the anticyclonic eddy and shallower concentration maxima
   inside the cyclonic eddy, with particles > 2 mm ESD at deeper
   levels, for both daytime and nighttime sampling. No systematic
   difference was detected between daytime and nighttime samples
   in 0-240 m integrated total particle abundance. However, at
   night particles appeared to be concentrated into three depth
   strata (10-50, 70-90 and 90-230 m) of different size-abundance
   composition, while during the day particles were distributed
   into one shallow (10-50 m) and one deeper stratum (70-240 m).
   Smaller particles always occupied the most shallow depths (C)

TI Observations of high-frequency internal waves in the Coastal
   Ocean Dynamics Region
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Current meter data from the second Coastal Ocean Dynamics
   Experiment (CODE II) for July 1982 are analyzed for internal
   waves in the 6 to 40 cycles per day (cpd) frequency band. It is
   found that the wave field is anisotropic and that the current
   ellipses are oriented in approximately the cross-isobath
   direction. The squares of the ratio of the major to minor axes
   of the current ellipses (the "ellipticity") are consistent with
   a continuum of internal waves propagating onshore but are not
   consistent with a single wave propagating onshore. The
   reduction of internal wave energy across the shelf is
   consistent with propagation from the deep ocean or shelf break,
   as is the correlation between vertical velocities and
   velocities parallel to the minor axis. However, there is
   evidence. for the generation of additional internal wave energy
   on the shelf in the evolution of the current ellipses across
   the shelf and in the bluing of the internal wave spectra across
   the shelf. Internal wave energy levels are elevated by a factor
   of 1.5 to 5 above Garrett and munk [1972] levels at the
   moorings on the 130 and 365 m isobaths. The first vertical mode
   dominates at the 130 m isobath, the only mooring far which the
   vertical modal analysis was done.

TI Physical processes contributing to harmful algal blooms in
   Saldanha Bay, South Africa
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE-SUID-AFRIKAANSE
   TYDSKRIF VIR SEEWETENSKAP
AB The study synthesises current understanding of the predominant
   physical processes responsible for the seasonality of harmful
   algal blooms, notably Alexandrium catenella and Dinophysis
   spp., in the nearshore environment of Saldanha Bay on the west
   coast of South Africa. Saldanha Bay is one of the few naturally
   sheltered areas on the South African coastline suitable for in
   situ shellfish farming and is the major site for the production
   of black mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in South Africa.
   Mussel farming started there in 1985 and the present level of
   production is some 2 700 tons per annum. Since 1994, disruption
   of harvesting as a result of the presence of harmful algal
   species has been a regular late-summer phenomenon. Toxic blooms
   that are ultimately advected into the bay develop on the
   continental shelf to the north between 32 degreesS and St
   Helena Bay, a region characterized by favourable conditions for
   dinoflagellate growth and circulation patterns that facilitate
   build-up of intense blooms during late summer, Offshore
   dinoflagellate populations are advected shorewards and
   polewards in response to relaxation of upwelling at the Namaqua
   cell to the north. Dinoflagellate blooms are advected south
   from the southern Namaqua shelf during upwelling relaxation.
   Under such conditions, the gyre south of Elands Bay moves
   offshore and a barotropic flow past Cape Columbine is
   established. Evidence suggests that the near-surface component
   of the flow occurs as a sudden "flood" event. These
   dinoflagellate-containing shelf waters are in turn advected
   into Saldanha Bay when upwelling relaxes, when the density
   gradient between the bay and the shelf drives surface inflow
   and bottom water outflow. These flows are reversed with the
   resumption of upwelling over the shelf, resulting in intrusion
   and entrainment of bottom water and surface outflow.
   Entrainment dictates that the bay acts as a net importer of
   bottom water and net exporter of surface waters over a synoptic
   cycle. This system of exchange between Saldanha Bay and the
   shelf curtails the duration and severity of toxic episodes in
   the bay relative to the shelf.

TI Wind-driven currents in the tropical Pacific
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB An analysis is made of the ensemble mean ageostrophic near-
   surface circulation measured by 1503 Lagrangian drifters
   drogued to 15-m depth in the tropical Pacific between 1987 and
   1994. It was found that the physical model of the wind-driven
   currents in a weakly stratified upper layer, in which the
   Richardson number remains near unity, accounts for 40% of the
   vector variance of the observations. In such a model, the
   amplitude of the current is proportional to u(*)(N/f)(1/2) and
   the depth scale of the wind-driven layer is proportional to
   u(*)(N/f)(-1/2). When the ageostrophic currents at 15-m depth
   are binned by the scaled Ekman depth, a net rotation of 0.87
   radians was observed through the layer depth. These
   measurements suggest that the vertical austausch coefficient of
   the upper ocean is proportional to u(*)(2)/N. Ekman proposed
   such a model based on two reports of wind-driven currents in
   1905 at widely separated latitudes.

TI The vertical structure of currents over the Continental Shelf
   off Point Sur, CA, during Spring 1990
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB A 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) was deployed
   off Point Sur, CA (36 degrees 17.8'N, 121 degrees 59.5'W) from
   28 February to 11 May 1990 to study the current response to
   local and remote forcing over a narrow continental shelf near a
   coastal promontory. The unit was moored 4 m off the bottom in
   water 84 m deep, and it profiled the currents in the water
   column in 4-m depth bins to within 12 m of the surface. The
   flow can be described in terms of the response to equatorward
   wind events Versus the response to poleward wind events and
   wind relaxations. During equatorward wind events, the current
   Vectors were directed equatorward and offshore near the surface
   at about 35 cm s(-1), then backed counterclockwise and
   decreased in magnitude with depth to about 10 cm s(-1), 4 m off
   the bottom. The vertical current structure during these events
   was well reproduced using a simple model in which the bottom
   Ekman layer was added to the unstratified model of Csanady
   (1982) for the wind-forced setup near a coast. The
   counterclockwise turning (as opposed to the open-ocean,
   clockwise sense) resulted from the interior geostrophic
   component, which overwhelmed the surface Ekman spiral and
   combined with the bottom Ekman layer to produce the observed
   vertical structure. The best agreement between the modelled and
   observed current vectors was obtained using a vertical mixing
   coefficient of about 12 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1). During poleward
   winds and wind relaxations, the currents were northward at
   about 20 cm s(-1) over most of the water column, then also
   backed counterclockwise as the bottom was approached. The more
   barotropic response during the weak poleward winds and wind
   relaxations showed no evidence for local wind forcing, which
   suggests forcing due to an alongshore pressure gradient arising
   from an alongshore surface slope of about 2 x 10(-7). The
   across-shore mass balance from the best-fit modelled flow held
   during upwelling events showed that the onshore transport in
   the lower water column was 2-3 times the offshore transport in
   the upper water column. This may be due to three-dimensional
   effects or to the across-shore adjustment drift (Csanady,
   1982), which feeds the alongshore geostrophic flow. (C) 1998

TI Moored observations of the current and temperature structure
   over the continental slope off central California 1. A basic
   description of the variability
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Current meter data have been analyzed from seven moorings on
   the continental slope along the central California coast, from
   Point Piedras Blancas to Point Reyes. The goal was to examine
   the subtidal variability in the 100 m to 1000 m depth range,
   particularly with regard to alongshore propagating events and
   interactions with eddies and meanders of the California Current
   offshore. The 2-year time series available off Point Sur were
   first analyzed in conjunction with the local and remote surface
   wind stress and coastal synthetic subsurface pressure, and then
   correlated with shorter coincident current records moored at
   similar depths to the north and south. The poleward flowing
   California Undercurrent was the most prominent feature at all
   the moorings except at one site located well into the Monterey
   Submarine Canyon. The strongest poleward flows over the slope
   occurred in 3- to 4-month bursts, not phase locked with the
   seasons, with vector speeds exceeding 40 cm s(-1). South of the
   canyon, an approximately monthly signal was identified which
   propagated poleward, upward, and offshore. The behavior of this
   signal was consistent with that of an internal coastal Kelvin
   wave generated at the surface by remote wind stress to the
   south and was likely not of equatorial origin. The wave was
   apparently scattered by the abrupt topography of the canyon,
   since its energy persisted to the north of the canyon but with
   unstable phase. At least three eddy-meander interaction events
   were observed, These warm, deep (>1000 m), anticyclonic
   features reversed the flow over the slope to equatorward when
   they moved onshore and interrupted the flow of the
   undercurrent, One event forced anomalously strong (>15 cm s(-
   1)) onshore flows off Monterey flay and offshore flows off
   Point Sur. While quantitative transport estimates could not be
   made with this sparse data set, it seems apparent that such
   events play a significant role in the exchange of water
   properties between the shelf and the deep ocean.

TI THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF COLD FILAMENTS NEAR POINT ARENA,
   CALIFORNIA, DURING JUNE 1987
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Shipboard conductivity-temperature-depth, acoustic Doppler
   current profiler, and continuous temperature and salinity
   observations were made in the coastal transition zone off Point
   Arena, California (39-degrees-N, 124-degrees-W), during June
   15-28, 1987, to describe the hydrographic structure and
   velocity fields associated with the cold filaments found there.
   An adaptive sampling plan was used to measure the properties of
   these filaments, guided in real time by satellite Advanced Very
   High Resolution Radiometer sea surface temperature imagery and
   feedback from the situ sensors.  The primary feature observed
   was a large, cool (12.0-degrees-13.5-degrees-C), salty (32.7-
   33.0 psu) filament which extended over 200 km offshore from
   Point Arena and exceeded 500 m depth.  This feature was bounded
   in the offshore direction by a continuous equatorward meander,
   with offshore velocities (60-87 cm s-1) on the northern edge of
   the cool filament and onshore velocities (69-92 cm s-1) along
   the southern edge, and persisted for at least 3 weeks.  A
   second feature was advected into the study area from the north
   by an anticyclonic eddy offshore and later merged with the
   Point Arena filament.  Smaller (30 km wide by 50-100 km long by
   50-100 m deep) very cold (10.0-degrees-12.0-degrees-C) high
   salinity (> 33.0 practical salinity units (psu)) features were
   observed within the Point Arena filament, but persisted for
   only 6-10 days.  The net volume transport of the larger feature
   was offshore at approximately 3 x 10(6) m3 s-1 and suggests it
   was fed by an inflow to the region from the north.  The smaller
   features were correlated with burst of equatorward wind stress
   on an event by event basis but not with times of large-scale
   wind stress convergence.  Surface drifters deployed during the
   experiment closely followed the surface dynamic topography.
   Some of the drifters followed the path of the offshore meander,
   while others moved south inshore.

TI TRANSPORT OF JUVENILE GEM CLAMS (GEMMA-GEMMA) IN A HEADLAND
   WAKE
SO ESTUARIES
AB Accumulation of bivalve recruits in the bottom convergence at
   the center of coastal eddies has been suggested as a possible
   mechanism resulting in locally abundant adult populations.  We
   investigated transport of juvenile gem clams (Gemma gemma) in a
   headland wake to determine whether they accumulated, and where.
   Velocity measurements during three flood tides showed that a
   wake consistently formed, but that flow speeds were too slow to
   transport juvenile clams to the eddy center.  Instead, the
   clams were deposited just inside the wake perimeter, where
   shear velocities decreased to levels below critical erosion
   velocities of the clams.  This result demonstrated that
   accumulation in a coastal flow separation can occur even in the
   absence of a well-defined eddy or a strong bottom convergence.
   Juvenile gem clams were carried, probably as bedload, to
   regions in the wake dominated by sediments with similar grain
   sizes, rather than similar fall velocities, suggesting that
   bedload transport was particularly dependent on particle
   diameter in this flow regime.  Adult gem clam populations
   tended to be locally abundant in regions receiving transported
   juveniles, but clam transport on any specific flood tide was
   not sufficient to fully predict the adult distributions.

TI Variability of the Azores Current during October-December 1993
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB The surface circulation is investigated during the autumn of
   1993 in the vicinity of the Azores Current 18-28 degreesW 31-36
   degreesN during the SEMAPHORE experiment. A total of 125
   drifters were tracked by satellite, some of which were drogued,
   some not, some with long tethers and some were mixed layer
   drifters drogued at 15 m depth. The different types of drifters
   respond differently to the wind, the wave action and the mixed
   layer currents, resulting in differences in drifts sometimes
   exceeding 10 cm s(-1). These effects can be partially taken
   into account statistically. After doing that, the different
   drift data were combined to map the near-surface quasi-
   geostrophic flow. The major currents in the area have a width
   of 100 km or larger, and changes in the shear happen over a
   shorter scale. The data density is sufficient to resolve scales
   of 50-100 km for 11 days averaged circulation and sea surface
   temperature (SST). The maps produced every 5 days portray the
   surface evolution of the Azores Current and of the eddy field
   for 2 months. The changes are large in the area where the
   Azores current interacts with a large anticylonic eddy A(I)
   associated with a Meddy. There are some closed eddy circulation
   present throughout the period, whereas other structures are
   relatively short-lived (a month or less). The general features
   of this analysis are reproduced in analyses of the circulation
   from altimetric data. The resolution of this analysis is much
   larger than what was earlier obtained from the hydrological
   surveys, enabling us to estimate the quasi-geostrophic
   mesoscale divergence field from the horizontal vorticity
   budget. The quasi-geostrophic horizontal vorticity advection
   provides the largest contribution to divergence and contributes
   to a series of convergence and divergence patches in the order
   of 1 X 10(-7) s(-1) associated with the various ridges and
   troughs of the Azores Current. Although uncertainty is high in
   these estimates, this suggests that vertical temperature
   advection does not contribute much to the surface temperature
   evolution at the mesoscales of these surveys. Horizontal
   temperature advection is estimated from the current and surface
   temperature analysis. Away from the frontal area near 25
   degreesW, horizontal temperature advection is significantly
   non-zero, but does contribute only a small portion of the
   observed temperature change at the mesoscales. The budgets
   suggest that the area south of A(I) was the site of subduction
   in October-November. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

TI Mesoscale distribution of fish larvae in relation to an
   upwelling filament off Northwest Africa
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB Fish eggs and larvae were studied in relation to an upwelling
   filament off Northwest Africa, near the Canary Islands, during
   August 1993. The filament was entrained around a quasi-
   permanent cyclonic eddy of diameter 100 km. The sampled
   ichthyoplanktonic community was dominated by neritic larvae,
   94.2% of which were captured in the oceanic area. Horizontal
   distributions of neritic and oceanic larvae were strongly
   influenced by the oceanographic features characteristic of the
   coastal margin. Neritic larvae were associated with upwelling
   and filament structures, while oceanic larvae were strongly
   excluded from these features. The results suggest that coastal
   upwelling and filaments are mechanisms of transport for neritic
   ichthyoplankton into oceanic waters, that sardine larvae are
   good tracers of offshore movements of upwelled waters, and that
   the cyclonic eddy functions as a larval nursery ground for
   neritic fish species. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

TI A numerical study of the dynamics and energetics of cool
   filaments, jets, and eddies off the Iberian Peninsula
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Considered are possible links between mesoscale features and
   the presence of topographic and/or coastline irregularities off
   the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, and what physical
   processes sustain the persistent filaments. The former is
   investigated by contrasting the results from two suites of
   three model runs differing only in the specification of
   topography and coastline irregularities and values assigned to
   key model parameters. In this a fairly simple 1 1/2-layer model
   is used. The latter is explored by use of an energy diagnostic
   scheme recently developed for multilayer models. On the basis
   of visual inspection and spectral analysis of the results, it
   is concluded that the physical processes leading to the
   formation, the separation distance, and the persistence of the
   filaments are largely independent of the presence of a variable
   topography and coastline irregularities. The role of the
   irregularities is to modify the qualitative appearance of the
   filaments and also to loosely anchor them to conspicuous
   topographic and/or coastline features. The variable topography
   alone modifies the appearance of the mesoscale structures and
   produces alongshore differences in the onset of instabilities,
   while coastline irregularities alone effectuate a delay in the
   onset of the initial small-scale, linearly unstable waves. The
   energy diagnosis reveals that the eddy kinetic energy linked to
   the filaments and other mesoscale structures is steadily
   extracted from the mean available gravitational energy via a
   combination of frontal instability and mixed frontal-
   conventional baroclinic instability. This cyclogenesis is made
   possible through the maintenance of a strong lateral front in
   both density and upper layer thickness close to the coast. The
   frontogenesis, in turn, is sustained by the persistent
   upwelling-favorable wind forcing.

TI Import of coastally-derived chlorophyll a to South slough,
   Oregon
SO ESTUARIES
AB Material transfer between estuaries and the nearshore zone has
   long been of interest, but information on the processes
   affecting Pacific Northwest estuaries has lagged behind other
   areas. The west coast of the U.S. is a region of seasonally
   variable upwelling that results in enhanced phytoplankton
   production in the nearshore zone. We examined estuarine-
   nearshore links over time by measuring physical oceanographic
   variables and chlorophyll a concentration from an anchor
   station in South Slough, Oregon. Data was collected during 24-h
   cruises conducted at approximately weekly intervals during
   summer 1996 and spring 1997. The results demonstrate that the
   physical oceanography of this estuarine site was strongly
   influenced by the coastal ocean. Marine water reached the
   estuarine site on every sampled tide, and chlorophyll. a was
   clearly advected into the estuary with this ocean water. In
   contrast, phytoplankton concentrations were comparatively
   reduced in the estuarine water. There were, however, large
   fluctuations in the import of chlorophyll over the course of
   the summer. These variations likely reflect upwelling-generated
   phytoplankton production in the coastal ocean and subsequent
   cross-shelf transport to the estuary. Suspension feeding
   organisms in South Slough likely depend on the advection of
   this coastally-derived phytoplankton. The large allochthonous
   chlorophyll input measured for this system appears dissimilar
   from most estuaries studied to date. Previous investigations
   have focused on the outwelling and inwelling of materials in
   estuaries. We must now consider the influence of coastal
   upwelling and downwelling processes on estuarine material
   exchange.

TI BIFURCATED FLOW FROM AN UPWELLING CENTER - A COLD-WATER SOURCE
   FOR MONTEREY BAY
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB AVHRR and CTD data from the Monterey Bay region during spring-
   summer 1989 show two basic hydrographic states, upwelling and
   relaxation. These occur in response to local wind forcing and
   are modified by interaction with a California Current meander.
   Upwelling at Pt Ano Nuevo, north of Monterey Bay, is identified
   as the source of cold, salty near-surface water frequently seen
   in the Bay. No evidence is found in any available data to
   support the commonly held belief that the Monterey Submarine
   Canyon is responsible for the introduction of upwelled water to
   the Bay's euphotic zone. During wind relaxations, upwelling
   ceases and a persistent California Current meander translates
   shoreward. Data support the idea that upwelling centers are
   associated with coastal headlands. The flow of upwelled water
   from these centers is bifurcated, with one tongue trending
   offshore and one equatorward. We propose a conceptual model to
   explain this pattern of flow and its impact on the California
   Current,

TI Compensation of horizontal temperature and salinity gradients

AB Establishment of the temperature-salinity relationship in the
   ocean has concerned oceanographers for decades because of its
   importance for understanding ocean circulation. High-resolution
   measurements in the ocean mixed Layer are used to show that
   temperature and salinity gradients on horizontal scales of 20
   meters to 10 kilometers tend to compensate in their effect on
   density. These observations support the notion of a horizontal
   mixing in the mixed Layer that depends on density gradient.

TI Inertial currents in the Indian Ocean derived from satellite

SO OCEANOLOGICA ACTA
AB Satellite-tracked surface drifters were used to analyze the
   characteristics of inertial currents in the tropical Indian
   Ocean. The drifters were drogued at 15 m depth and had wind-
   produced slips less than 0.1 % of the wind speed. The rotary
   spectra of surface velocity components indicated the
   significance of inertial currents. They are circular (rotary
   coefficient > 0.5), highly intermittent and contribute up to 46
   % to the total kinetic energy of the surface flow field. Events
   of inertial activity, either triggered by the passage of
   atmospheric disturbances or by the local fluctuations in the
   atmospheric pressure (winds), did not last for more than 4 to 5
   inertial cycles. The observed inertial frequency exhibited a
   shift towards the red end of the spectrum by 12 %. Cyclonic
   storm induced inertial events even at a location 300 km away
   from it. (C) 2000 Ifremer/CNRS/IRD/Editions scientifiques et

TI Seasonal and interannual variability of currents and
   temperature off central Chile
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Results are reported for continuous, 6 year records of current
   and temperature from a continental slope station at 30 degrees
   S off Chile. These observations for November 1991 to November
   1997 span the moderate, weak, and strong El Nino events of
   1991-1992, 1994, and 1997 and the La Nina event of 1995-1996.
   Results for current and temperature are analyzed together with
   observations of wind along the South American coast from the
   ERS-1 and -2 satellite scatterometers, wind from a local
   coastal site, sea level from northern and central Chile, sea
   surface temperature anomalies from the South Pacific region,
   and traditional El Nino indices. Mean poleward flow of 12.8 cm
   s(-1) was observed for the 6 year period in the core of the
   Peru-Chile Undercurrent (220 m). Mean flow in the depth range
   of Antarctic Intermediate Water (750 m) was equatorward at 1.1
   cm s(-1). Intraseasonal-scale variability associated with
   coastal trapped waves was weaker during the austral winter:
   greatest during El Nino events and weakest during the La Nina
   event. Winds adjacent to the coast showed a strong annual cycle
   with a southward progression of maximum equatorward (upwelling
   favorable) winds. Alongshore flow over the slope exhibited
   strong semiannual and weaker annual variations. Poleward flow
   in the undercurrent was strongest in the austral spring and
   fall and weakest in the winter. Near the bottom (750 m),
   seasonal-scale variability was less intense but led that higher
   up in the water column (220 m) by similar to 1 month. Strong
   interannual variability of alongshore current and temperature
   was found at all depths over the slope, whereby changes at
   depth led changes higher up. A rapid warming event was observed
   at the end of 1996-beginning of 1997 over the slope. This
   event, also seen in sea level and sea surface temperature off
   Chile, led El Nino indices by several months and may be best
   explained by local wind anomalies coupled to atmospheric
   teleconnections from the western tropical Pacific at the onset
   of El Nino. Some aspects of our current and temperature
   observations are consistent with results from eastern boundary
   current models. Our results indicate that both ocean and
   atmosphere pathways from the equatorial Pacific contribute
   significantly to interannual-scale variability of alongshore
   flow and thermocline depth off Chile.

TI Winter upwelling off Luzon in the northeastern South China Sea
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB A major upwelling region centered about 100 km offshore between
   16 degrees and 19 degrees N off northwest Luzon in the South
   China Sea is revealed in the distributions of temperature,
   salinity, and dissolved oxygen concentration during a cruise in
   December 1990. Upward movement of water low in dissolved oxygen
   can be identified to a depth of 300 m. Climatological
   distributions of temperature and upper ocean heat content and
   tracer distribution obtained from a recent numerical experiment
   lend support to the existence of this upwelling region. Results
   from a general circulation model of the South China Sea further
   show that upwelling off Luzon occurs between October and
   January, in agreement with the climatological data. Current
   structures obtained from a simple two-layer model and the
   general circulation model both suggest that this upwelling is
   not driven by local winds but contains a large, remotely forced
   component arising from the basin circulation. The upwelling is
   sustained by offshore Ekman drift from above and a converging
   northward undercurrent from below. The would-be downwind
   coastal jet in the surface layer is largely offset by currents
   associated with the winter circulation gyre. Upwelled water
   with high nutrient content spreads southwestward in January and
   could be an important nutrient source for the surface water in
   the interior South China Sea in spring.

TI SURFACE CIRCULATION IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB A three-dimensional, primitive-equation model with a free
   surface is used to simulate the monthly circulation in the
   South China Sea. The model has a resolution of 0.4 degrees in
   the horizontal and 21 layers in the vertical in a region from 2
   degrees N to 24 degrees N and from 99 degrees E to 124 degrees
   E. Inflow and outflow in the Kuroshio, through the Taiwan
   Strait, and between the Sunda Shelf and the Java Sea are
   prescribed bimonthly. At the sea surface, the model is forced
   by monthly-averaged climatological winds and temperature and
   seasonally-averaged salinity. Several important features are
   reproduced in the model simulation. First, a strong coastal jet
   is present at the western boundary. The current is southward
   along the continental margin from China to southern Vietnam in
   winter. In summer, the current is northward and separates from
   the coast between 11 degrees N and 14 degrees N. The transition
   in September begins as a southward undercurrent, which is
   remotely forced by the northeast monsoon in the northern
   reaches of the south China Sea. The undercurrent extends to the
   surface in about a month. Second, inflow through the Luzon
   Strait from October to February transports the Kuroshio water
   in the top of 300 m of the water column westward along the
   continental slope south of China. In summer, eastward flow in
   the Luzon Strait transports surface water west of Luzon to the
   region east of Taiwan. Finally, a subsurface current, which is
   opposite to the surface current, exists over the Sunda Shelf
   and is driven by a pressure gradient set up by monsoon winds.
   These simulated currents are in qualitative agreement with the
   circulation inferred from the available observations.

TI Diagnosis of the three-dimensional circulation in mesoscale
   features with large Rossby number
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Several diagnoses of three-dimensional circulation, using
   density and velocity data from a high-resolution, upper-ocean
   SeaSoar and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) survey of
   a cyclonic jet meander and adjacent cyclonic eddy containing
   high Rossby number flow, are compared. The Q-vector form of the
   quasigeostrophic omega equation, two omega equations derived
   from iterated geostrophic intermediate models, an omega
   equation derived from the balance equations, and a vertical
   velocity diagnostic using a primitive equation model in
   conjunction with digital filtering are used to diagnose
   vertical and horizontal velocity fields. The results
   demonstrate the importance of the gradient wind balance in flow
   with strong curvature thigh Rossby number). Horizontal
   velocities diagnosed from the intermediate models (the iterated
   geostrophic models and the balance equations), which include
   dynamics between those of quasigeostrophy and the primitive
   equations, are significantly reduced (enhanced) in comparison
   with the,geostrophic velocities in regions of strong cyclonic
   anti-cyclonic) curvature, consistent with gradient wind
   balance. The intermediate model relative vorticity fields are
   functionally related to the geostrophic relative vorticity
   field; anticyclonic vorticity is enhanced and cyclonic
   vorticity is reduced. The iterated geostrophic, balance
   equation and quasigeostrophic vertical velocity fields are
   similar in spatial pattern and scale, but the iterated
   geostrophic land, to a lesser degree, the balance equation)
   vertical velocity is reduced in amplitude compared with the
   quasigeostrophic vertical velocity. This reduction is
   consistent with gradient wind balance, and is due to a
   reduction in the forcing of the omega equation through the
   geostrophic advection of ageostrophic relative vorticity. The
   vertical velocity diagnosed using a primitive equation model
   and a digital filtering technique also exhibits reduced
   magnitude in comparison with the qua sigeostrophic field. A
   method to diagnose the gradient wind from a given dynamic
   height field has been developed. This technique is useful for
   the analysis of horizontal velocity in the presence of strong
   flow curvature. Observations of the nondivergent ageostrophic
   velocity field measured by the ADCP compare closely with the
   diagnosed gradient wind ageostrophic velocity.

TI Diagnosis of the three-dimensional circulation associated with
   mesoscale motion in the California current
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB A high-resolution upper-ocean survey of a cyclonic jet meander
   and an adjacent cyclonic eddy in the California Current region
   near 38 degrees N, 126 degrees W was conducted as part of the
   summer of 1993 Eastern Boundary Currents program. Temperature
   and salinity were measured from a SeaSoar vehicle, and velocity
   was measured by shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler
   (ADCP). SeaSoar data show a density front at a depth of 70-100
   m with strong cyclonic curvature. The geostrophic velocity
   fields, referenced to the ADCP data at 200 m, show a strong
   surface-intensified jet (maximum speed of 0.9 m s(-1)) that
   follows the density front along a cyclonic meander. Relative
   vorticities within the jet are large, ranging from -0.8f to
   +1.2f where f is the local Coriolis parameter. The SeaSoar
   density and ADCP velocity data are used to diagnose the
   vertical velocity via the Q-vector form of the quasigeostrophic
   omega equation. The diagnosed vertical velocity field shows a
   maximum speed of 40-45 m d(-1). The lateral distribution of
   vertical velocity is characterized by two length scales: a
   large (similar to 75 km) pattern where there is downwelling
   upstream and upwelling downstream of the cyclonic bend, and
   smaller patches arrayed along the jet core with diameters of
   20-30 km. Geostrophic streamline analysis of vertical velocity
   indicates that water parcels make net vertical excursions of
   20-30 m over 2-3 days, resulting in net vertical velocities of
   7-15 m d(-1). Water parcels moving along geostrophic
   streamlines experience maximum vertical velocities in the
   regions of maximum alongstream change in relative vorticity, an
   indication of potential vorticity conservation.

TI Summer surface circulation on the Newfoundland shelf and grand
   banks: The roles of local density gradients and remote forcing
SO ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN
AB Summer surface circulation on the Newfoundland Shelf and Grand
   Banks is diagnosed from observed density profiles using the
   method proposed recently by Sheng and Thompson (unpublished
   manuscript). To assess the accuracy of the predictions they are
   compared against all available near-surface current
   measurements for the region. In accord with earlier studies,
   local density gradients alone cannot account for the summer
   surface circulation in this region. The surface currents
   diagnosed from the density field are much weaker than the
   observations, particularly near the shelf break. To explain the
   discrepancy we use a simple inverse method to infer the optimal
   inflow boundary conditions for a barotropic model from the
   differences between the observed and diagnosed currents. The
   surface circulation is then modelled as the sum of the
   diagnosed baroclinic component and the remotely-forced
   barotropic component Overall the predicted circulation pattern
   agrees reasonably well with the current observations and maps
   of the mean surface circulation based on a variety of data
   sources. The predicted circulation pattern has identifiable
   inshore and offshore branches of the Labrador Current that
   split and merge as they encounter the main banks and saddles of
   the region. The mean square of the observed currents (J(obs))
   is reduced by 52% on removal of the combined effect of local
   density gradients and remote forcing. Removing the baroclinic
   component alone reduces J(obs) by 40%. Our conclusion is that
   both remote-forcing and local density gradients make
   significant contributions to the circulation in this region.
   For example the strong shelf-break flow on the northeast
   Newfoundland Shelf appears to be due mainly to remote-forcing
   while the circulation over Flemish Cap, and the narrow coastal
   jet off southeast Newfoundland are due mainly to local density
   gradients.

TI The dynamics of northwest summer winds over the Santa Barbara
   Channel
SO MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
AB A mesoscale model is used to examine the dynamics of northwest
   flow over the Santa Barbara Channel region. Three cases are
   considered, each characterized by typical summertime synoptic
   conditions, but with differences in pressure gradient strength
   and marine boundary layer depth (MBL). The first case examines
   a relatively deep MBL and strong pressure gradient. Case 2 is
   characterized by a more shallow MBL and weaker pressure
   gradient, and case 3 represents a transition from a deep MBL to
   shallow conditions. In all cases, simulated surface winds show
   reasonable agreement with observations over most of the model
   domain, with the exception of regions near abrupt terrain
   changes. Results from the model indicate that the flow with a
   deep MBL (similar to 400 m) and strong pressure gradient (case
   1) is supercritical, causing regions of acceleration and
   expansion in the lee of Point Conception. When the MBL is
   shallow (similar to 150 m) (case 2), a transcritical flow
   scenario exists with subcritical flow upstream from Point
   Conception and a supercritical flow region over the Santa
   Barbara Channel and downstream from the Channel Islands. Flow
   over the channel is strongly affected by diurnal heating in
   shallow MBL cases, reversing direction in step with a land
   breeze circulation induced by nighttime cooling. The land
   breeze forces an internal wave disturbance that propagates
   westward across the channel, eliminating the supercritical flow
   region in the lee of Point Conception. Conditions with a deep
   MBL (similar to 400 m) produce less variability in the surface
   winds, except for the region sheltered by the Santa Ynez
   Mountains. An expansion fan is still evident in this case, but
   it is produced by the interaction of the flow with higher
   terrain north and east of the channel. The low hills on Point
   Conception and the Channel Islands do not have a large blocking
   effect on the surface flow when the MBL is deep. Analysis of
   the momentum budget supports the conclusion that the boundary
   layer behaves like a transcritical hydraulic flow when the MBL
   is shallow. Except for the open ocean region, the Coriolis term
   is minor in comparison with the pressure and advection terms.
   Diurnal heating effects are evident in the nearshore pressure
   term, which varies from offshore during the late evening to
   onshore in the afternoon. These effects are most significant
   when the MBL is shallow and can augment the hydraulically
   forced pressure pattern, causing a stronger expansion fan in
   the late afternoon and a collapse of the expansion fan during
   the early morning.

TI Altimeter-derived variability of surface velocities in the
   California Current System: 2. Seasonal circulation and eddy
   statistics
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Satellite surface height and temperature fields are used to
   examine the seasonal surface circulation in the California
   Current System. In spring and summer, an equatorward jet
   develops next to the coast, with an initial latitudinal
   structure that responds to the latitudinal distribution of
   equatorward alongshore winds. This jet moves offshore from
   spring to fall and develops meanders and dosed eddies that
   contribute eddy kinetic energy and water mass properties to the
   nearby deep ocean. Higher EKE appears first in spring near the
   coast and moves offshore with the seasonal jet. Along altimeter
   tracks parallel to the coastline 200 and 400 km offshore, the
   greatest EKE is found in summer and fall, respectively, with
   wavelengths of approximately 300 km. These are the wavelengths
   of the largest meanders and the distance between the largest
   eddies visible in altimeter "snapshots" of the jet. At 600-800
   km offshore, the wavelengths are generally smaller (100-150
   km), similar to eddy sizes reported by others for the quiescent
   northeast Pacific. Some energy with longer wavelengths arrives
   at the track 600 km offshore in winter and 800 km offshore in
   spring, which we interpret as the most offshore extension of
   the EKE generated by the jet and eddy system closer to the
   coast in the previous spring and summer. A sequence of
   snapshots from October 1992 to October 1993 shows details of
   the evolution of the jet and eddy system over one complete

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE-SUID-AFRIKAANSE
   TYDSKRIF VIR SEEWETENSKAP
AB Satellite surface height and surface temperature fields are
   used to examine the seasonal surface circulation in the
   Benguela and California Current systems. In the California
   Current system, an equatorward jet develops in spring and
   summer near to the coast, with a latitudinal structure that
   responds to the equatorward longshore winds. This jet moves
   offshore from spring to autumn and contributes eddy kinetic
   energy to the deep ocean. In the Benguela system north of 32
   degreesS, winds are upwelling-favourable and currents are
   equatorward all year, but stronger in summer. The current
   strengthens in summer, when water parcels with high steric
   heights move into the region offshore of the jet from the
   Agulhas Retroflection area at the same time that steric heights
   next to the coast drop as a result of coastal upwelling. Off
   the Cape (32-34 degreesS), winds and currents are more
   seasonal. The Geosat altimeter fields do not resolve the
   equatorward flow along the SST front next to the coast in
   spring and summer, but Dick up strong equatorward flow off the
   Cape in autumn and winter, after the front moves offshore.

SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Data from the Coastal Transition Zone (CTZ) experiment are used
   to describe the velocity fields and water properties associated
   with cold filaments in the California Current.  Combined with
   previous field surveys and satellite imagery, these show
   seasonal variability with maximum dynamic height ranges and
   velocities in summer and minimum values in late winter and
   early spring.  North of Point Arena (between 39-degrees-N and
   42-degrees-N) in spring-summer the flow field on the outer edge
   of the cold water has the character of a meandering jet,
   carrying fresh, nutrient-poor water from farther north on its
   offshore side and cold, salty, nutrient-rich water on its
   inshore side.  At Point Arena in midsummer, the jet often flows
   offshore and continues south without meandering back onshore as
   strongly as it does farther north.  The flow field south of
   Point Arena in summer takes on more of the character of a field
   of mesoscale eddies, although the meandering jet from the north
   continues to be identifiable.  The conceptual model for the
   May-July period between 36-degrees-N and 42-degrees-N is thus
   of a surface jet that meanders through and interacts with a
   field of eddies; the eddies are more dominant south of 39-
   degrees-N, where the jet broadens and where multiple jets and
   filaments are often present.  At the surface, the jet often
   separates biological communities and may appear as a barrier to
   cross-jet transport, especially north of Point Arena early in
   the season (March-May).  However, phytoplankton pigment and
   nutrients are carried on the inshore flank of the jet, and
   pigment maxima are sometimes found in the core of the jet.  The
   biological effect of the jet is to define a convoluted, 100 to
   400-km-wide region next to the coast, within which much of the
   richer water is contained, and also to carry some of that
   richer water offshore in meanders along the outer edge of that
   region.

TI DRIFTER OBSERVATIONS OF A COLD FILAMENT OFF POINT ARENA,
   CALIFORNIA, IN JULY 1988
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB We use the position fixes and temperature readings from 56
   Tristar-II mixed-layer drifters, in conjunction with advanced
   very high resolution radiometer images, to provide a
   description of the mesoscale variability of the flows
   associated with cold-water filaments in the California Current
   system off nor-them California in July 1988. We find that the
   northern, offshore temperature front of the filament is
   convergent and is closely associated with the core of a high-
   speed (> 100 cm/s) jet that has a broader spatial scale than
   the cold-water filament. Mesoscale features are observed to be
   related to all developments of the cold-water filament on a
   variety of time scales (1-30 days). In one well-observed
   feature, estimates of vertical velocity (w) based on a
   vorticity budget are -20 m/d over an area of 150 km2 and are
   associated with a gain of vorticity. Estimates of w based on a
   local heat budget following a drifter are about 3 times larger
   over an area of 60 km2. These intense downwelling features are
   also places where horizontal stirring occurs.

TI Satellite-measured chlorophyll and temperature variability off
   northern Chile during the 1996-1998 La Nina and El Nino
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Time series of satellite measurements are used to describe
   patterns of surface temperature and chlorophyll associated with
   the 1996 cold La Nina phase and the 1997-1998 warm El Nino
   phase of the El Nino - Southern Oscillation cycle in the
   upwelling region off northern Chile. Surface temperature data
   are available through the entire study period. Sea-viewing Wide
   Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data first became available in
   September 1997 during a relaxation in El Nino conditions
   identified by in situ hydrographic data. Over the time period
   of coincident satellite data, chlorophyll patterns closely
   track surface temperature patterns. Increases both in nearshore
   chlorophyll concentration and in cross-shelf extension of
   elevated concentrations are associated with decreased coastal
   temperatures during both the relaxation in El Nino conditions
   in September-November 1997 and the recovery from EI Nino
   conditions after March 1998. Between these two periods during
   austral summer (December 1997 to March 1998) and maximum El
   Nino temperature anomalies, temperature patterns normally
   associated with upwelling were absent and chlorophyll
   concentrations were minimal. Cross-shelf chlorophyll
   distributions appear to be modulated by surface temperature
   frontal zones and are positively correlated with a satellite-
   derived upwelling index. Frontal zone patterns and the
   upwelling index in 1996 imply an austral summer nearshore
   chlorophyll maximum, consistent with SeaWiFS data from I 1998-
   1999, after the El Nino. SeaWiFS retrievals in the data set
   used here are higher than in situ measurements by a factor of
   2-4; however, consistency in the offset suggests relative
   patterns are valid.

TI A current velocity index of ocean variability
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB We use daily time series of the longshore component of residual
   (detided) current velocity v(z, t) measured at several depths
   at a single location on the continental slope to construct a
   current velocity index, I-v = alpha\v'(s) partial derivative
   v/partial derivative z\partial derivative v/partial derivative
   z variability. Here z is depth, t is time, and alpha = -
   sgn(f)[f(2)+delta(2))sigma(v)](-1) factor constructed from the
   local Coriolis parameter f, a friction parameter delta, and the
   standard deviation sigma(s) of the near-surface current
   velocity, v(s) = <(v)over bar (s)>+v'(s), where v'(s) is the
   fluctuation about the time series mean <(v)over bar (s)>,;
   sgn(f) = +1 for the northern hemisphere and -1 for the southern
   hemisphere. The time series of vertical shear, partial
   derivative v/partial derivative z approximate to Delta v/Delta
   z, is derived from the velocity difference by between
   simultaneous current meter records separated by a vertical
   distance Delta z within the upper half of the water column. The
   index characterizes low-frequency baroclinic variability over
   the continental margin and is linked, through use of the
   thermal wind relation, to instability processes that effect the
   transfer of potential energy stored in the mean cross-slope
   density field to the kinetic energy of mesoscale meanders and
   eddies. For eastern boundary regions the index ranges from
   large positive values during summer upwelling conditions to
   large negative values during winter downwelling conditions. The
   ''transition'' seasons, spring and fall, are characterized by
   I, approximate to 0. We demonstrate use of the index by
   applying it to the continental margin of southwest Vancouver
   Island using current velocity data collected from October 1989
   to March 1995 at depths of 35, 100, 175, and 400 m at a long-
   term mooring site. Results enable us to specify the start and
   end times of the oceanic seasons and to quantify the summer
   upwelling and winter downwelling intensities for the region.
   Gaps in the current meter time series prompted us to examine
   records of coastal sea level, sea surface temperature, sea
   surface salinity, and ''Bakun'' upwelling index (the wind-
   driven cross-shore component of surface Ekman transport) as
   possible surrogates for the velocity index. None of these time
   series were acceptable. Although the Bakun index is a logical
   substitute for the velocity index, differences between the two
   indices are significant and suggest that current velocity data
   are needed for accurate delineation of seasonal oceanic
   variability along continental margins.

TI Particle fluxes in a coastal upwelling zone: sediment trap
   results from Santa Barbara Basin, California
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Particle fluxes were measured in the center of Santa Barbara
   Basin on a bi-weekly basis for a three-year period beginning in
   August 1993. Lithogenic material dominates the total flux
   throughout the entire year, although it is delivered to the
   basin primarily during the winter rainy period. It appears that
   both biological and physical processes control the eventual
   transport of detrital material to the deep part of the basin.
   Biogenic sedimentation in Santa Barbara Basin is dominated by
   opaline silica, with highest fluxes during the spring-summer
   upwelling period. Export ratios (ratios of organic carbon Bur
   to primary production) are inversely related to primary
   production. This relationship may be due to increased advective
   transport and/or enhanced regeneration of organic carbon during
   the highly productive upwelling period. During the first half
   of the study period, Santa Barbara Basin was influenced by El
   Nino conditions and our data suggest that productivity in this
   region is reduced during such periods. Seasonal changes in the
   relative contributions of biogenic and lithogenic material to
   the total particle flux, combined with the lack of bioturbation
   on the sea floor, results in the accumulation of varved
   sediments in Santa Barbara Basin. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

TI Carbon and nutrient dynamics during coastal upwelling off Cape
   Blanco, Oregon
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and
   concentrations of the nutrients phosphate (P) and silicate (Si)
   in coastal surface waters within a 100 km x 300 km area
   centered on Cape Blanco, Oregon, were mapped at high resolution
   during August 17-27, 1995. Alkalinity and the concentration of
   total CO, were determined on a subset of stored samples. Over
   the 9-18 degrees C range in sea-surface temperatures
   encountered during the cruise, PCO2, and P and Si
   concentrations varied between 150-690 mu atm, < 0.1-1.8, and <
   1-33 mu mol/kg, respectively. Spatial variations in the
   intensity of coastal upwelling set the wide range in surface
   water properties. Acoustic Doppler current profiler data
   collected throughout the cruise indicate the advective nature
   of many chemical features. PCO2 data also indicate the presence
   of an intense phytoplankton bloom in continental shelf waters
   along the coast north of Cape Blanco, with little evidence of
   biological drawdown to the south. The available data do not
   provide an unambiguous explanation for this contrast. Surf-zone
   water was sampled from shore at 17 locations along the cruise
   areas on August 25 and 26, 1995, concurrently with the
   shipboard measurements. PCO2, and P and Si concentrations,
   varied in the range 250-640 mu atm, 0.3-2.0, and 1.1-42 mu
   mol/kg, respectively. North of Cape Blanco, the chemical
   expression of upwelling was considerably stronger in the surf-
   zone than at all locations sampled on board ship because the
   phytoplankton bloom did not extend to the coast. South of Cape
   Blanco, concentrations of upwelling tracers measured on board
   ship within a distance of 5-10 km from the coast and in the
   surf-zone were comparable. Vertical nutrient profiles across
   the continental shelf show that the composition of surf-zone
   water is consistent with conservative advection of nutrient
   enriched bottom water from the edge of the continental shelf to
   the surf-zone. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

TI Near-surface trajectories off central and southern California
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB The near-surface circulation in the Santa Barbara Channel and
   off the coast of central and southern California is described
   based on 20 releases of drifters drogued 1 m beneath the
   surface from 12 sites within the channel at bimonthly
   intervals. This description includes small-scale features of
   the circulation which are not part of descriptions based on
   moored observations or of the statistics of the drifter
   releases. The eventual fate of drifters at long time intervals
   compared to the residence time in the channel (about 7 days) is
   also included. In the channel the trajectories document a
   persistent cyclonic circulation with a typical recirculation
   period between 3 and 5 days. In the spring, currents near the
   mainland are weaker than near the Channel Islands, and the
   overall flow is toward the southeast. Trajectories document the
   possibility for water parcels to leave the channel through the
   interisland passes. In the late fall and winter a poleward flow
   with velocities often exceeding 0.5 m s(-1) is confined within
   20 km of the mainland. Between these two seasons the cyclonic
   tendency is enhanced, although most of the drifters eventually
   migrate westward. The trajectories of drifters released at the
   same time from sites only 20 km apart can be remarkably
   different. Once the drifters migrate out of the channel, their
   trajectories can be grouped into a few patterns. In spring and
   summer, drifters tend to remain in the Southern California
   Eight. Their trajectories often remain close over extended
   periods, as if they were caught in convergence zones. In fall
   the drifters often are caught in a poleward current.

TI Coastal retention and longshore displacement of meroplankton
   near capes in eastern boundary currents: Examples from the
   California Current
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE-SUID-AFRIKAANSE
   TYDSKRIF VIR SEEWETENSKAP
AB Nearshore larval retention mechanisms influence the dispersal
   and recruitment patterns for a wide variety of meroplanktonic
   species in eastern boundary regions. Areas of coastal larval
   retention associated with capes in eastern boundary currents
   provide important spatial structure to coastal populations of
   fish and invertebrates through their influence on longshore
   settlement variability. Some patterns observed in the northern
   California Current for three meroplanktonic species groups
   (crabs, sea urchins and rockfish) relative to two such apparent
   retention features are synthesized. It is found that spatial
   variability in settlement of crabs is predictable at the scale
   of headlands. Apparent timing of upwelling intermittency and
   variability on weekly One-scales, as indicated by temperature
   change, is critical to interannual settlement variability. The
   average magnitude of upwelling, measured by an upwelling index,
   is by comparison a poor predictor of interannual settlement
   variability. Distribution of planktonic larvae relative to a
   nearshore retention feature is dependent on taxon. These
   nearshore retention features may act as reservoirs for some
   taxa or as conduits to the coast for others, likely depending
   on larval behaviour, timing and cross-shelf location of release
   relative to upwelling features. The longshore variability in
   recruitment created by the above patterns can result in
   differences in subpopulation productivity. For example,
   strength of a cohort of yea urchins varies longshore in
   accordance with proximity to retention features.

TI Meroplanktonic distribution and circulation in a coastal
   retention zone of the northern California upwelling system
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Previous studies have shown that settlement of several crab
   species along the coast north of Point Reyes (38 degrees 00'N,
   123 degrees 00'W occurs primarily during relaxation from
   upwelling, when warm water flows poleward from the Gulf of the
   Farallones. During 1994 and 1995 we sampled planktonic larval
   distributions and hydrography both south and north of Point
   Reyes during upwelling to test whether high concentrations of
   crab and rockfish larvae were concentrated in the source of the
   relaxation flow to the south of Point Reyes. An upwelling plume
   off Point Reyes and an "upwelling shadow," indicated by warmer,
   less saline water in the northern Gulf, were evident in both
   years, as were frontal regions that marked the boundaries
   between water types of three different types: (1) newly
   upwelled, (2) oceanic, and (3) San Francisco Bay outflow. In
   addition, there was a fourth type, termed Gulf water, that was
   a mixture of these three types. Concentrations of larvae of
   cancrid, pinnotherid, and "coastal" crabs and rockfishes were
   high south of Point Reyes but were low or absent in the newly
   upwelled water north of the point. Within the upwelling shadow,
   these meroplankton taxa were associated with different water
   masses. Several intertidal crab species and early-stage cancrid
   crabs were concentrated in San Francisco Bay outflow water, and
   coastal Gulf water late-stage cancrid crabs, early- and late-
   stage pinnotherid crabs, and rockfishes were concentrated at
   the frontal region between newly upwelled and Gulf water. Of
   the taxa examined, only rockfishes were found offshore in
   oceanic water. The high concentrations of meroplankton observed
   suggest that the Gulf of the Farallones is an important
   retention area for larvae that settle into coastal populations
   in the Gulf and to the north via poleward transport during
   upwelling relaxation.

TI WATER CIRCULATION IN THE GULF OF PAPUA
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB The Gulf of Papua has the shape of a half-moon of radius of
   about 200 km and mean depth <50 m. The freshwater inflow is
   large, about 15,000 m(3) s(-1) with little seasonal variation.
   The entire Gulf is stratified in salinity in the top 20m. The
   halocline, sharpened by strong winds, inhibits tidal mixing in
   the Gulf, even in shallow coastal waters where tidal currents
   are >1 m s(-1). The dominant M(2) tide propagates from the
   Coral Sea through the Gulf to enter both Torres Strait and the
   large estuaries of Papua New Guinea, The low-frequency currents
   have, in costal waters, little vertical shear associated with
   the salinity stratification, but, at the shelf break, a strong
   vertical shear in the well-mixed layer typically 100 m thick. A
   dominant forcing of the circulation in the Gulf is the
   eastward-flowing Coral Sea Coastal Current in the Northwest
   Coral Sea, This current appears to generate a counter-clockwise
   rotating eddy in the Gulf. The wind fluctuations result in the
   brackish water leaving the Gulf alternatively at its western
   and eastern sides. The residence time of river runoff in the
   Gulf, estimated using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model,
   is about 2 months and this estimate agrees with that from
   freshwater budget estimates. Brackish water intrudes in the
   Torres Strait where tidal mixing maintains vertical
   homogeneity. The tidal mixing front is located near the
   northern tip of the Warrior Reefs and the intrusion is
   strongest in the monsoon season.

SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Wind, wave and currents measurements at 9 and 14 meter water
   depths on the shoreface off U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Field
   Research Facility at Duck, North Carolina are presented.
   Coastal setup accompanied by southerly-setting alongshore
   currents and seaward cross-shore currents is developed during
   Northeasterly storms. Coastal set-down, with reversal currents,
   is generated by Southerly or southwesterly strong winds.
   However, while the current speed during Northeasterly storms is
   strongly correlated with the wind stress, this relationship
   does not hold during Southwesterly storms. This is attributable
   to the fact that downwelling-favorable Northeasterlies enhance
   the coastal jet and act to reinforce the coastal plume that
   often issues from the Chesapeake Bay.

   from February 1996 to February 1997, a drifter free region,
   called the "forbidden zone", is found over the southern portion
   of the West Florida Shelf. This finding is consistent with
   historical drift bottle data and with a recent numerical model
   study of the West Florida Shelf circulation response to
   climatological wind forcing. Direct drifter simulations by
   numerical model during March 1996 show a good agreement with
   both the in situ ADCP current observation and drifter
   observation. Three mechanisms are proposed for the observed
   Lagrangian features. The primarily dynamic mechanism is the
   along-shore wind forcing, which induces a coastal jet that
   tends to leave the coast and the bottom onshore and near
   surface offshore transports. The second one is the convergent
   coastal geometry and bottom topography for the southward flow
   in central shelf near Tampa Bay that enforces the coastal jet
   and the bottom and near surface transport. The last is a
   kinematic one, simply due to the short along-shore Lagrangian
   excursion, driven by the typical synoptic weather systems. Thus
   near surface shelf waters over the north may not reach the
   southern coast of the West Florida. Implication is that surface
   hazard such as oil spill that may occur outside of the southern
   West Florida shelf may not greatly impact the southern coastal
   region except Florida Keys. However, the biological and
   chemical patches over the north that may occur in the water
   column such as red tides still can easily reach the southern
   coastal region through the subsurface and bottom waters. (C)

TI Surface currents in the Canary Basin from drifter observations
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Satellite-tracked drifting buoys, deployed in the Canary Basin
   as part of the Subduction Experiment between July 1991 and
   October 1993 and the French Semaphore Experiment during October
   1993, were used to obtain a description of surface currents and
   temperature in the Canary Basin. The study focuses on surface
   water convergence, eddy energy production, and heat transport.
   The Azores Current associated with the subtropical convergence
   zone is clearly visible at 34 degrees N, and bifurcates around
   22 degrees W, with the major branch of the current circling the
   Madeira plateau and joining the Canary Current along the
   continental slope. Eddy kinetic energy maxima are found along
   the Azores Current. The mean current revealed a region of
   maximum convergence north of the Azores Current around
   longitude 29 degrees W occurring with a negative heating
   anomaly and positive work done by the Reynolds stress. The
   southward meridional temperature fluxes in the Ekman layer (0-
   50 m) between 37 degrees W and the African and European coast
   are estimated between -0.076 +/- 0.022 x 10(15) W, produced by
   mean southward volume transport in our study area. The residual
   between local surface heat fluxes and horizontal convergence of
   heat implies a vertical heat convergence process associated
   with mesoscale temperature and flow fields.

TI Dissipation and mixing in a coastal jet: A Baltic Sea case
   study
SO AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB Vertical profiles of dissipation rate are used to study mixing
   properties within a shallow water region influenced by a
   coastal jet. In the upper 10-m layer dissipation rates of the
   order of epsilon proportional to 10(-6) W kg(-1) have been
   measured. Most dissipation results from local production of
   turbulent kinetic energy, caused by Reynolds-stress in the
   coastal jet. Some high-energetic turbulent events are not
   locally balanced and are most probably advected to the
   measurement site by the coastal jet. Estimates of the
   associated eddy diffusivities for locally balanced situations
   are in the order of K-p proportional to 10(-4) m(2)s(-1). This
   comparably high value is due to the high level of turbulence
   throughout the water column and high mixing intensity
   (gamma(mix) approximate to 0.22). This feature is clearly
   related to the coastal jet in its stratified environment.
